\newglossaryentry{VentilationLimited}
{
	name=Ventilation Limited,
	description={a fire in which the heat release rate or growth rate is controlled by the amount of air available to the fire (NFPA 921)}
}

\newglossaryentry{OpenConcept}
{
	name=Open Concept or Open Floor Plan,
	description={having few or no internal walls or partitions. A home with few or no internal walls or partitions}
}

\newglossaryentry{GreatRoom}
{
	name=Great Room,
	description={a large, open room in a house, especially a living room that doubles as a family or dining room}
}

\newglossaryentry{DecayStage}
{
	name=Decay Stage,
	description={the phase of fire where the heat release rate begins to decline either due to lack of fuel (fuel limited) or lack of oxygen (ventilation limited)}
}

\newglossaryentry{IntendedFanFlowPath}
{
	name=Intended Fan Flow Path ,
	description={the theoretical path the air flows along when a positive pressure fan is used for positive pressure attack and or positive pressure ventilation. It is possible to have multiple intended fan flow paths in a single structure.}
}

\newglossaryentry{Tenibility}
{
	name=Tenibility,
	description={the measure of whether or not a space can be occupied. This level may vary with the protective clothing provided. For example, an atmosphere may not be tenable for a civilian where it is tenable for a firefighter in full structural PPE including SCBA. In addition a compartment may be untenable for a firefighter in full structural PPE including SCBA, for example a compartment involved in flashover or post flashover conditions}
}


\newglossaryentry{PPV}
{
	name={Positive Pressure Ventilation},
	description={the use of high powered ventilation fans to remove products of combustion from a fire building, after the fire has been controlled}
}

\newglossaryentry{PPA}
{
	name={Positive Pressure Attack},
	description = {the use of Positive Pressure Ventilation to control the flow of products of combustion, prior to fire control, with the intent of providing increased visibility and tenability for firefighters and potential occupants while fire suppression efforts are underway}
