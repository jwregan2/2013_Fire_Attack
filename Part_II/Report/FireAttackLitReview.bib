  abstract     = {Gas cooling is a technique used within the fire service to reduce the risks of the hot gaseous layer and create a better visibility. It is achieved by applying water into the gaseous layer. Successfully performing or implementing this technique is something that has not yet been accomplished in every brigade.

This work has been focused on different parameters that affect gas cooling and is studied by the use of experiments. Tests were conducted in a half scaled ISO 9705 room using nozzles at a fixed position and angled at 45° with the floor. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate how the flow rate, droplet size, application time and spray pattern affect the cooling and contraction of the gaseous layer.

Out of the experimental results, conclusions could be drawn that gas cooling was most effective using sprays with the smallest droplets that can reach the end of the room. In this work, a hollow cone nozzle with droplet diameters of 500 m performed the best results.

Water should be applied in the gaseous layer as fast as possible whether it be in short pulses or as a continuous flow. If pulses are used, the time in between a pulse should not exceed 0.5 seconds. A gas layer contraction was not observable at this small scale although a velocity decrease of the outflowing gases was measured. 

After the water application, gas cooling provided a buffer time of at least 7 to 10 seconds before the gases returned at their initial temperatures.},
