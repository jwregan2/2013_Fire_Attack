\chapter*{abstract}

As research continues into how fire department interventions affect fire dyanmics in the modern fire environment; questions continue to arise on the impact and implications of interior versus exterior fire attack on both firefighter safety and occupant survivability. Previous research into various types of fire ground ventilation, flow paths, and exterior fire streams has provided the fire service with a more in-depth understanding of fire dynamics in addition to raising questions about certain fire attack methods stemming from differing traditions and myths. This knowledge gap and lack of previous research into the impact of fire streams has driven the need for further research into fire department interventions at structure fires with a focus on hose streams and suppression tactics. Statistics show that both firefighters and building occupants continue to loose their lives due to fire. As such, research into the various methods of fire attack will allow a broader understanding of how firefighter interventions on the fire ground can impact the outcome of both life safety and property protection. 

This study will build and expand upon the fire research conducted to date by analyzing how firefighting tactics, specifically suppression methods, affect the thermal exposure and survivability of both firefighters and buidling occupants in addition to impacting fire behavior in structures. The project will be comrprised of 2 parts:

\chapter*{Introduction}

The purpose of this study is to improve firefighter safety, fireground tactics, and the knowledge of fire dynamics by providing the fire service with credible scientific information, developed from both water flow and full-scale fire testing, in representative single family homes, on the impacts and implications of both interior and exterior fire attack. Part I of the study is aimed at quantifying air entrainment in nozzles to provide insight into how hose streams move air inside buildings and determining where water is distributed in compartments. These series of tests were conducted without the presence of fire in order to gain a basic understanding of air flow and water flow before Part II of the study was conducted as full-scale fire experiments. The full-scale fire experiments were designed based on the results from Part I of this study. Each test in both Parts I and II were designed to evaluate the differences in various application methods, nozzle types and patterns, pressures/flows, and stream location and angles.

\chapter{Background}

Recent fire service research has highlighted the importance of applying water to the fire as quickly as possible. This tactical consideration has highlighted a knowledge gap and increased the interest in better understanding the impact of water applied as part of an interior attack or exterior attack. Many variables exist in fire attack that impact firefighter effectiveness and victim survivability, stream placement, the timing required to get water on the fire, stream type, stream movement, air entrainment, steam development, hot gas cooling and contraction and position of flow paths. The fire service's most important tool for many years at structure fires is their hose line, however many questions have arisen as more research shows the impact of ventilation, flow paths and exterior fire streams. Whether a fire attack crew chooses to apply water as part of an interior attack or as part of an exterior or transitional attack they need to know what impact their stream has on the fire environment ahead of them. This is difficult on the fire ground because visibility is commonly limited and therefore all of their experience is from behind the nozzle. This results in beliefs about conditions (e.g., temperature), ahead of the nozzle and its impact on victim survivability but knowledge of actual impact has not been researched. Additionally, when the fire is ultimately suppressed that does not mean it was done most effectively, efficiently and safely but the experience gained suggests that it was. Fire service adages such as ``don’t put water on smoke,'' ``you will steam the victims,'' and ``fog nozzles always disrupt the thermal layer'' have been passed on from generation to generation with little context or substantiation. Without the context these concepts get treated like rules and can severely limit firefighters understanding of fire suppression.

Fire training curriculum defines 3 fire attack methods, direct attack, indirect attack and combination attack. Direct attack involves the discharge of water directly onto the burning fuel. Indirect attack involves directing the stream toward the ceiling of a compartment in order to generate a large amount of steam in order to cool the compartment. Converting the water to steam displaces oxygen, absorbs the heat of the fire and cools the hot gas layer sufficiently for firefighters to safely enter and make a direct attack. Combination attack extinguishes a fire by using both a direct and indirect attack. Another technique to safely approach a fire that cannot be reached with a direct attack is gas cooling. Gas cooling provides a buffer zone around the attack team but the larger the compartment the less the impact on cooling the hot gas layer. Gas cooling must be a continuous process while advancing toward a shielded fire. Techniques for effective gas cooling and the upper limit of the volume where gas cooling is effective is not well known.  

In fire fighter training there is a lot of emphasis on steam generation but little is taught or demonstrated about the mechanics of suppression. Water vaporized in the upper gas layer reduces the total volume of the hot gases and steam. Water vaporized on hot surfaces such as the ceiling does not take much energy from the fire and therefore the volume of steam produced lowers the upper layer and makes conditions less tenable. These concepts are very important when the fire is not able to be directly attacked by applying water on burning fuel but is very difficult to visualize during a fire attack with limited visibility. Many of these fire suppression concepts are difficult to learn and refine because realistic ventilation limited fires are not safely replicated in firefighter training structures. Conditions created by todays fuels with heat release rates and smoke production properties commonly found in our structures are not allowed when following fire service training standards. Therefore the impact of hose streams in concrete training structures or metal containers can be misleading to firefighters resulting in incorrect inferences. This may then lead to inappropriate fire ground tactics with potentially deadly results. Research is needed to better understand the impact of hose streams so that proper messages can be taught in fire service training programs.

There are potentially harmful effects of inappropriate water application regardless of the type of hose stream. Since firefighters today are more aware of the need to cool hot smoke (fuel) in the upper layer, it is essential to understand the capabilities and limitations of each type of stream. The impact of hose stream application as one advances during a fire attack is dependent on a number of factors, principle of which are the flow path and where the steam is produced (in the hot gas layer or on contact with hot surfaces). Continuous application is likely to result in more steam being produced than gas contraction in the hot gas layer. Without ventilation in front of the hose stream, this can result in a reduction in tenability. However, when victims or firefighters are not in the flow path, and ventilation is in front of the hose stream, a combination attack can be quite effective for fully developed fire conditions.

Fire suppression effectiveness and firefighter safety are not achieved by water flow rate alone, but by appropriate use of a given flow rate under specific fire ground conditions. A flow rate must meet the critical flow rate to extinguish a fire depending on the heat release rate and should be higher to reduce the time to extinguishment. Drastically exceeding the critical flow rate has less impact on time to extinguishment but has a significant impact on the total amount of water used. There is little data to support that dramatically exceeding the critical flow rate results in increased firefighter safety. It has been estimated that only 5 to 10 percent of water applied during fire attack contributes to extinguishment. It is difficult for firefighters to realize the the efficiency of various hose stream techniques due to poor visibility on the fireground. However, by developing data in realistic structures, fuel sources, and fire scenarios, important inferences may be developed relative to different hose stream techniques, and use of water.

\chapter{Objectives and Technical Plan}

\section {Objectives}

The purpose of this study was to provide the fire service with scientific based knowledge on the impact of interior and exterior fire attack tactics on firefighter safety and trapped occupants to improve training and decision making on the fire ground. This was accomplished with the completion of the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve firefighter safety by increasing knowledge of fire behavior.
	\item Develop knowledge of water streams applied during an interior and exterior/interior fire attack and its impact on firefighter safety and victim survivability.
	\item Understand where water goes and how air flows during interior and exterior/interior fire attack utilizing common procedures and what that means to fire dynamics within a structure.
	\item Gain understanding of the impact of water streams depending on the volume of the fire compartment/structure.
	\item Advance the understanding of victim survivability in the modern fire environment by working with experts in the use of pig carcasses and rodents.
	\item Develop and implement a methodology to measure moisture content in the modern fire environmental conditions to answer fire service concerns.
	\item Bring the `Science to the Streets' by transferring science based tactical considerations founded on experimental results that can be incorporated into firefighting standard operating procedures.
	\end{itemize}

All five of the Technology \& Fire Service Science issues facing the fire service determined during the 2nd National Fire Service Research Symposium \cite{NFFF} were incorporated into this study.

\section{Technical Plan}

This study consisted of the following tasks shown in the figure below. Part I of the study details the specifics of the project related to the results from Tasks 7A and 7B.

\item \bf{Task 1 – Formation of a Project Advisory Panel}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 1 will bring together an advisory panel of technical experts in the fire service; and fire service research field. An open application process will be administered to find fire service experts in fire stream application and training in fire attack methods. Representatives from organizations including: CFD (Chicago Fire Department), FDNY (Fire Department of New York), IAFC (International Association of Fire Chiefs), IAFF (International Association of Fire Fighters), NVFC (National Volunteer Fire Council), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and career and volunteer representatives from urban, suburban, and rural fire departments will be invited to participate. Invitations will also be extended to representatives of major fire service publications and training material publishers. This well rounded panel allows UL to ensure their research is directed to the target audiences and that the end product of the research is able to be easily disseminated into practice.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 2 – Incident Review}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 2 is to leverage our fire service advisory panel to conduct an extensive search to find examples of well documented successful and unsuccessful interior and exterior fire stream applications. This will be completed by monitoring fire service websites for videos and after action reports where there are defined flow paths and clear fire service fire attack actions. With approval of the fire department these incidents will be examined in detail to determine the impacts of fire stream type, flow, pattern and placement on the outcome of the incident, firefighter safety and victim injuries if applicable. Everyday the fire service is learning through their own experience and the experience of others through the means of sharing video. To make sure our experiments are tied in best with common fire service experiences we will identify trends in these incidents and tie the research results to the experience or beliefs gained from these incidents.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 3 – Test Supplies, Instrumentation and Contractor Acquisition}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 3 will allow for UL to acquire research supplies and instrumentation to complete this project. Instrumentation includes thermocouples to measure thermal conditions that potential victims or firefighters would be exposed to, differential pressure sensors and bidirectional probes to measure pressure and gas velocity throughout the test fixtures, bullet cameras to capture interior views of the test fixtures to provide visual evidence of conditions. Other test equipment such as data loggers, gas analyzers, thermal imaging cameras and video cameras were acquired from previous studies and will be utilized during this study. A contractor will also be selected to construct the test house structures using construction practices representative of what would be found in most neighborhoods across the country.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 4 – Develop Moisture Measurement Technique}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

During this task different commercially available moisture measurement technologies will be examined for their ability to make moisture measurements in conditions that will be created in the full-scale house experiments. These conditions include elevated temperatures and a high density of particulate. This measurement will allow for the ability to map where steam travels in the structure to assess the impact of steam on fire victims and on fire service steam burns.

Several well established instruments exist to characterize the environmental conditions within a structure containing fires by measuring a variety of effluent gases along with temperature, heat flux and flow characteristics. However, the ability to measure moisture content in conditions applicable to describing fire environments, particularly after water has been applied to suppress the fire, is not presently available. The effect of measuring moisture at elevated temperatures is critical for hazard assessments for both firefighters operating within a structure and potential victims who are trapped in the structure. In the SFPE Handbook, Purser suggests that:  “… it is possible that the presence of water vapor may be an important neglected hazard in fires”, and, “Humid air, steam or smoke with a high thermal capacity of latent heat (due to vapor content or suspended liquid or solid particles) may be dangerous at temperatures of around 212~$^{\circ}$F (100~$^{\circ}$C), causing burns throughout the respiratory tract. It may be possible to predict the likely effects of hot-smoke atmospheres if thermal capacity or latent heat were measured.” 

Thus, the ability to measure moisture concentration in such environments is a critical avenue of research for firefighter safety as well as to fully understand the impact of tactical decisions on trapped victim safety. It is of particular importance to know the moisture content in the rooms adjacent to the fire room at the level of occupants crawling on the floor (1~ft above the floor) or on furnishings (3~ft above the floor). Based on past experimental results, the temperatures observed at these levels in rooms adjacent to the fire room are typically under 400~$^{\circ}$F.  

Commercially available moisture sensors have been developed recently for industrial process control, but these have not been studied for applicability to the live fire conditions. At the University of Illinois, Professor Dimitrios Kyritsis’ lab has advanced multiple techniques based on electrical and laser based measurements of gases during internal combustion engine operation that can be adapted to the sooty, dynamically changing live-fire environment. While there are a large number of techniques to measure moisture, most are inapplicable to the situation of high temperature moisture measurements in a combusting environment. Two techniques that could have use in these types of environments are infrared absorption techniques and electrical impedance techniques. There are two different methods to measure moisture using electrical impedance, resistive methods and capacitive methods. Both methods measure the relative humidity of the environment. Each method has its own set of advantages, with the resistive methods having a faster response time, while the capacitive methods can resolve relative humidity measurements all the way to 0\% RH. It is for this reason that the capacitive methods are most useful for this application, since at temperatures around 400 oF and volume percent of H2O under 10\%, the relative humidity will be under 1\% RH. Resistive methods do not accurately measure relative humidity under 5\% RH.  

Absorption spectrometry is another possible technique for measuring moisture content in harsh, high temperature environments. Water has several absorption bands in the near-infrared range, which allows the use of tunable diode lasers to measure the moisture content. With proper thermal and optical control of the laser source and sample train such a technique should be operable at temperature exceeding 1800~$^{\circ}$F, be able to operate in and compensate for sooty and smoky environments, and have a very rapid response time on the order of seconds. Such approaches have been utilized to perform in-situ analysis from controlled combustion and process exhaust systems. However, due to the nature of the live-fire experiments studied here, an extraction technique may have to be implemented. Such techniques will be designed and tested at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign prior to the full-scale tests.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 5 – Test Fixture Design}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 5 is the design of the test fixtures to be used in the experiments. The main test fixtures will be two single family residential home (1200 ft$^2$ single story ranch house) to be constructed in UL’s Large Fire Facility. This is the near the same design built for the three previous ventilation research grants and will therefore allow continuity of previous results to expand our knowledge. One of the main test fixtures will be altered to constructed an open floor plan so that gas cooling can be analyzed in different volumes. The test fixture will be furnished with contents that is representative of common households and refurnished after each experiment. Additional test fixture details are provided in the Appendix.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\clearpage

\item \bf{Task 6 – Design of Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 6 is the design of the experiments. In this task UL’s project engineers will work closely with the advisory panel to ensure fire service concerns are addressed and that the results will be of great benefit to the end users. All experimental variables, equipment, personnel, infrastructure and other resources will be evaluated to determine the best set of experiments to get the most for the investment and provide the largest return to the fire community. Variables such as types of nozzles, flow rates, nozzle patterns, ventilation parameters, timing of tactics, ignition location, and fuel loading will be discussed and selected during a technical panel meeting.  
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 7 - Conduct Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\subitem \bf{Task 7A:  Water Flow Mapping (Interior and Exterior Applications)}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip} 

Methodology: Conduct a series of experiments in a compartment constructed to determine where water goes once discharged from fire department nozzles during a simulated interior fire attack and exterior fire attack. The ability to suppress a fire safely and efficiently is dependent on how much water absorbs energy from the fire and what surfaces are cooled. A combination of water mapping techniques that are commonly used for characterizing sprinkler sprays will be utilized to determine flow distribution. The compartment will be of similar size to the fire rooms in the full-scale fire experiments so that the results can be linked.

Water will be flowed utilizing common fire department nozzles with 3 patterns (combination nozzle in a straight stream pattern, combination nozzle in a narrow fog pattern and a smooth bore nozzle pattern). Different nozzle techniques that are commonly taught to firefighters and utilized in practice will be evaluated such as circular motions, z patterns, flowing off the ceiling and flowing ahead. Common flow rates for each nozzle will be used during the experiments. We will also calibrate our remote water delivery method that will be utilized during Tasks 7E and 7F to distribute the water in a repeatable manner to what would be done by firefighters. Several experiments will be done in triplicate to examine repeatability.  

Measurements: The actual delivered density apparatus (described later) will be used to determine water distribution, video cameras will be used to document the nozzle techniques and gross water distribution. Data from this Task will be analyzed and used to design the experiments described in Task 7E, 7F, and 7G.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\subitem \bf{Task 7B:  Air Flow and Pressure Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Methodology: Conduct air flow and pressure experiments in the test fixtures prior to the introduction of any fire. Different hose streams and nozzle movement techniques entrain different amounts of air which can greatly impact fire dynamics, firefighter safety and victim survivability. The same nozzles, stream types and nozzle techniques will be used as Task 7A and the amount of air flow created and pressures generated in the structure will be measured. Different flow paths will also be established to see their impact such as having a ventilation point ahead of the hose-line and having no ventilation opening ahead of the hoseline. We will also examine air movement generated by 1 ¾ in., 2 ½ in. hand-lines and flows from master-stream devices (deck gun and ladder pipe).

Measurements: During each of these experiments, velocities will be measured with anemometers and bidirectional probes attached to differential pressure gauges. Pressures will be measured with differential pressure gauges and HVAC air balancing measurements will be made. This data will allow for the analysis of air movement and its impact on fire growth measured in Tasks 7E and 7F.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\subitem \bf{Task 7C:  Moisture Measurement Validation Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Methodology: The candidate moisture measurement techniques identified in Task 4 will be validated by this series of experiments. A bench scale apparatus will be designed and constructed that will allow the team to carefully calibrate moisture concentrations at temperatures up to 500~$^{\circ}$F and in the presence of potential confounders such as typical fire effluent gases and dense smoke conditions. A closed loop flow bench will be designed with a radiative heating element and moisture injection ports allowing adding controlled volumes of moisture to initially dry room air. These ports will also allow controlled metering of CO and CO2 as well as fire smoke effluent collected from live-fire burn experiments.

Measurements: Moisture percentage will be measured and compared against controlled ambient conditions. Initial measurements will be made in a controlled environment with known temperature and moisture concentrations up to 500~$^{\circ}$F, (max 3~ft temperatures in bedrooms found in the Vertical Ventilation Study (source***)). After validation in these environments, a controlled concentration of potential confounders will be added to the test bench included typical fire gases (CO2, CO) and varying soot concentrations.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\subitem \bf{Task 7D:  Pig Carcass Benchmarking Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Victims trapped within a structure face the risk of thermal burn injuries, particularly with unprotected skin. Suppression activities by the Fire Service can reduce this hazard by removing the heat source producing these dangerous conditions, however, the additional risks encountered by the conversion of water to steam must be studied. The risk for moisture related skin burns is likewise present for firefighters applying water to burning materials from inside the structure. While firefighting PPE provides a significant measure of protection, burn injuries are still a significant hazard during interior firefighting operations.

The dangers of thermal injury from exposure to heat and products of combustion and time-temperature characteristics required for skin burns has been researched for several years. Typical studies involve exposing skin to a controlled thermal exposure and the time to an outcome, such as dermal or epidermal temperature changes or visual indications of damage. The synergistic effect of elevated temperature and moisture content on skin is conceptually understood due to the large latent heat and partial pressure of water at temperatures above 140~$^{\circ}$F. However, the effect of suppression tactics and the rapidly changing transient nature of exposure during this time frame (ambient temperature reducing, moisture content increasing) on risk for skin burns has not been measured in response to realistic fire suppression experiments. 

Most commonly, porcine skin is used as a surrogate for human skin in burn studies (source**) as pig skin is more human like than any other readily available animal (source***). Furthermore, epidermal and dermal thicknesses for 3-4 month old swine are similar to an average human is estimated to be 70~µm, and 2-3~mm. Pig carcasses have been successfully utilized in place of live animal studies in part because the water loss from the skin of a live pig does not differ significantly from a carcass (source**).

Methodology: In order to better understand burn injuries to both firefighters and potential occupants pig carcasses will be placed in various target rooms at different locations (1~ft and 3~ft from the floor) near the moisture sampling measurements during the house fire experiments. Pig carcasses will be obtained through the University Of Illinois College Of Veterinary Medicine after they have completed their research tasks at the University. The 3-4 month old pigs will be of similar weight and have skin thickness (epidermal layer ~60-80~µm, dermal thickness of 1-3~mm) that is comparable to human skin and can be analyzed as a surrogate for potential human skin damage. Prior to inclusion in the live-fire structure, samples will be exposed to varying levels of radiant and convected heat with controlled moisture content to establish a baseline for comparison of damage as a function of exposure.  

Measurements: Thermocouples will be sewn onto the skin surface and under the pig’s dermal layer using sutures to measure temperature gradient and establish the time line for first degree (skin surface at 113~$^{\circ}$F) and third degree (sub-dermal temperatures reach 113~$^{\circ}$F). In the scenarios where sections of the pig will be covered by firefighting PPE, temperature and relative humidity (to measure penetration of moisture through the PPE) will be measured on the exterior and interior of the clothing in the same area. Using the instrument developed and validated in Task 7C moisture concentration will be measured in the immediate vicinity of the exposed pig. Skin damage will be well documented visually for comparison with the carcasses utilized in Tasks 7E-G.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\subitem \bf{Task 7E:  Interior Fire Attack Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Methodology: A series of 12 full-scale house fire experiments will be conducted with simulated interior fire attack. The house will be furnished with modern furnishings and each experiment will have identical content.  A fire will be ignited in the master bedroom and the flow path will be altered to simulate scenarios that the fire department would arrive to or that would be created by fire department operations. The first 6 experiments will examine fire department arrival to a closed house with a ventilation limited fire. The front door will be opened creating a flow path. This will be repeated 5 times, utilizing 2 different hose streams, a controlled door, a coordinated ventilation opening, and once with no water application.  

Five victim locations will be instrumented and the flow path the attack crew would be advancing through will be instrumented to examine conditions that the crew would be exposed to. The hosestream will be applied utilizing a monitor nozzle that will be able to advance on a set of tracks and will be programmed to flow the desired pattern and motion. The second set of experiments will add a second flow path by ventilating the master bedroom window. This will increase the size of the fire but will provide a low pressure point opposite of the attack crew. This will be repeated 5 times with two different hose stream patterns, two different hose line advances, and once with no water application until the front door flow path closes up and fire extends out of the front door. A third set of experiments will add a third flow path through Bedroom 2. Again 2 different hose stream patterns will be examined, two difference advances will be tested, and one experiment where no water is applied until fire extends out of the front door of the structure.

Measurements: Measurements will be made to examine the fire dynamics in the test fixture, the exposure to firefighters in the flow path and to potential victims in several locations. The test fixture will be instrumented to measure temperature in every room, gas concentrations, pressure, gas velocity, thermal imaging and digital video. These measurements will allow for quantification of fire behavior, the impact of the water application and tenability for firefighters and occupants. Five victim measurement packages will be placed in the test fixture.  The packages will consist of temperature measurements at multiple elevations, gas concentration measurements (oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide), heat flux with water conditioned to 98 degrees to get more accurate heat transfer to skin, an instrumented pig carcass, a moisture measurement device and a video camera.

\subitem \bf{Task 7F:  Exterior Fire Attack Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Methodology: A series of 6 full-scale house fire experiments will be conducted with simulated offensive exterior fire attack. A fire will be ignited in the master bedroom and the flow path will be altered to simulate scenarios that the fire department would arrive to or that would be created by fire department operations. The first 4 experiments will examine fire department arrival to fire extending out of the master bedroom window. Water will be applied through the window, utilizing 3 different hose streams. Five victim locations will be instrumented to examine conditions that they would be exposed to. The hose stream will be applied utilizing a monitor nozzle that will be programmed to flow the desired pattern and motion. The second set of experiments will add a flow path by ventilating the Bedroom 2 window. This will increase the size of the fire and will allow it to begin to spread into Bedroom 2. This will be repeated 3 times with three different hose stream patterns and once with no water application. A third set of 2 experiments will ignite the fire in the master bedroom and Bedroom 2 with both of their windows open (Figure 10). Once fire is extending out of both bedroom windows 2 different hose stream patterns will be examined by flowing water into the master bedroom window.

Measurements: Same measurements as Task 7E, Interior Fire Attack Experiments.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\subitem \bf{Task 7G:  Large Volume Suppression Experiments}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Methodology: A series of 8 experiments will be conducted that are the same as the first 8 interior fire attack experiments with the exception that all of the interior walls in the test fixture will be removed except for the walls to the master bedroom (Figure 11 and Figure 12).  This increased volume will allow for the analysis of gas cooling as a result of indirect attack in an open floor plan when the fire can not be accessed with the hose stream without crawling into the structure through the flow path. The fire will be allowed to develop until temperatures in the large volume would require an advancing attack crew to cool the upper gas layer in order to advance to the bedroom fire.  The advancing crew will be simulated just as in Task 7E so that the 2 configurations can be compared, compartmented floor plan versus modern open floor plan.

Measurements:  The test fixture will be instrumented to measure temperature in every room, gas concentrations, pressure, gas velocity, thermal imaging and digital video. Four victim locations will be instrumented to examine conditions that they would be exposed to. These measurements will allow for quantification of fire behavior, the impact of the water application and tenability for firefighters and occupants. The data will be analyzed and compared to the compartmented measurements from Task 7E.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}
 
\item \bf{Task 8 – Data Compilation and Analysis}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 8 is the compilation and analysis that will be conducted by UL engineers to make the data usable by the fire community. The data will be organized in graphs that will be reviewed by the technical panel in preparation for the final report and the online training program. The focus of the analysis will be to calculate tenability conditions for potential victims and firefighters during each of the scenarios. In addition, tactical considerations will be developed in conjunction with the fire service advisory panel. Each of these considerations will be supported by data, experimental video evidence and actual fire incidents documented in Task 2 and incorporated in the technical report and outreach program.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 9 – Design and Develop Outreach Program}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

In task 9, UL engineers will work with instructional designers to produce an interactive training program for the fire community. The final program will be shared via the www.ULfirefightersafety.com website, www.Modernfirebehavior.com website, and UL FSRI Social media accounts free of charge to the fire service. The course will be consistent with previous courses developed by UL as shown in the figures below. The course will contain data, pictures, video and professional narration and allow firefighters of all levels to navigate through the course at their own speed. This program will include linkages to tactical considerations learned from the previous three studies on horizontal, vertical and positive pressure ventilation and the Governor’s Island experiments completed in partnership with FDNY and NIST.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 10 – Develop Final Project Report}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 10 is the development of the final report that details all of the experiments and results. The report will be provided to DHS and made publicly available via UL’s website for the fire service, www.ULfirefightersafety.com to serve as a reference for future research. The tactical considerations developed with the technical advisory panel will be a focus within the report. A fire service summary report will also be written and disseminated that includes critical information for firefighter safety.
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\item \bf{Task 11 – Disseminate Project Results}
\normalfont
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Task 11 is the dissemination of the research results. Results are shared by presenting in venues such as the National Fire Protection Association Annual Conference, Fire Department Instructors Conference, International Association of Fire Chiefs Fire Rescue International, and the International Association of Fire Fighters Annual Conference. These venues provide a large number of attendees from the fire service and research communities and are a formal means to disseminate the results of the study. Additional dissemination will include publication in fire service trade magazines and peer reviewed journals. As with previous outreach results, videos and presentation content will be made available at request to be used for local dissemination and for train the trainer programs. Continued dissemination is achieved by making the final project report and online training program available via UL’s websites for the fire service, www.ULfirefightersafety.com and www.Modernfirebehavior.com. We will also share project results on our and our partners social media channels, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and our Fire Engineering Radio Show, “Research to Tactics.”

\section{Limitation and Scope}

The fire attack study is not intended to establish which methods of fire attack are more effective when compared to others. More specifically, the study is not intended to dictate tactics or the purchasing of one type of nozzle over another. The purpose is to quantify the amount of air entrainment in nozzles given certain parameters as well as determine where water is distributed within a compartment. This is all without fire involvement in order to provide a baseline understanding before moving forward with the remainder of the study. This baseline knowledge is intended to bridge the gap in the fire service understanding about the use of various nozzles, application patterns, and advancement techniques in specific scenarios. Knowing how hose streams affect air movement and how water is distributed can allow for better decision making capabilities across the fire service when it comes to equipment purchasing and use during an actual emergency incident.

When analyzing the air entrainment and water distribution, equipment from various manufacturers was tested. For the purpose of the study, the companies will be referred to as Manufacturer 1, Manufacturer II, and Manufacturer III. The air entrainment experiments yielded results that showed little to no difference among the various manufacturers. Therefore, a single manufacturer was chosen for the remainder of Part I of the study.

Each and every fire department across the world utilizes different personal protective equipment, firefighting equipment, staffing levels, apparatus, standard operating procedures, and tactics. Additionally, no two fires are identical as well. Thus provides a challenge for researchers when evaluating what can be varied versus held constant during testing. For the purpose of these experiments we utilized the same structure throughout all of the air entrainment experiments. The water distribution testing utilized another structure, which also remained the same for the duration of those experiments. The only component of the firefighting equipment that was varied among the tests was the nozzle, and sometimes the hose line size. The hose line was either 1 3/4~in or 2 1/2~in in diameter and was always 200~ft in length. By creating some aspects that were not varied and by bounding other variables, we ensured that all aspects of the air entrainment and water distribution were examined as a baseline for further future evaluation in different structures with different conditions.

\chapter{Project Technical Panel}

In order to better design and implement the experiments for the Fire Attack study, UL - FSRI has gathered a group of fire service experts from across the world with knowledge in fire suppression and the impact of interior and exterior fire streams. Announcements were made regarding the open application period for firefighters of all ranks and experience to participate in the study. After the application period closed, the UL - FSRI team evaluated the responses for those with training and experience specifically related to fire suppression operations. In addition, the team selected applications which encompassed a wide variety of ranks and geographic areas to ensure that the majority of the tactics used in the United States, including some international presence, would be represented. The panel members selected best represent the firefighters' experience with fire attack and the impact on safety and survivability.

\chapter{Previous Literature}

At the start of the study, a literature review was performed to identify and analyze the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Previous research in the field of air entrainment, water distribution, and fire suppression
	\item Previous research into victim burns and survivability in fires
	\item Both past and current fire suppression tactics 
	\item Knowledge gaps in fire suppression operations (choice of tactics, myths, traditions, etc.) 
\end{itemize}

The following section outlines some of the material as it relates to the fire attack study. The literature review encompassed past research work, various articles in fire service publications, fire service training manuals, fire department standard operating procedures, as well as line of duty injury/death reports to highlight some of the critical areas of information which drove the project at hand.

\section{Literature Overview}

Hose, nozzles and water have been used by the fire service for hundreds of years. Despite their frequent use, there has been little scientific research conducted on the effective use of these tools for fire suppression. It is common in the fire service to find discussions about which nozzle is better or which flow rate is required for what sized fire but this is based on experience and usually not science. 

In 1950 Chief Lloyd Layman presented a paper titled “Little Drops of Water” at the Fire Department Instructors Conference. He introduced what he called indirect method of attack to suppress interior building fires by using the heat absorbing properties of expanding and condensing steam, produced in great quantities by fog streams. The conclusions were based on Coast Guard experiments that Layman was in charge of conducting at the Coast Guard Firefighting School at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, MD. Layman continued his experiments after he returned to his position as fire chief in Parkersburg, WV where he applied his tactic in building fires.  This research had a very large impact on the fire service and their suppression techniques to this day. 

Throughout the 1950’s a National Committee began conducting experiments to collect data on the growth and behavior of interior fires and how to most effectively suppress them. Keith Royer and Bill Nelson were members of this committee, and as the heads of the firemanship training program at the Iowa State University’s Engineering Extension, they collected and analyzed data from hundreds of experimental fires. Through this research the fire service was taught about fire behavior and how to suppress fire with a combination fire attack. They examined the amount of heat generated by common fuels, the heat absorbing capacity of water, the impact of compartment volume during suppression and they developed the Iowa formula. The Iowa formula or critical rate of flow formula is still used today and it determines the amount of water needed to control a fire in the largest open space within a structure by dividing the cubic foot volume of the space by 100.

While the physics of fire development has not changed over time, the fire environment for specifically the single family home has evolved. Several factors including home size, geometry, contents and construction materials have changed significantly over the past 50 or more years. Each of these factors has impacted firefighter and occupant safety. Faster fire propagation, shorter times to flashover, rapid changes in fire dynamics and shorter escape times all impact fire service suppression techniques and effectiveness. Many of the variables in Royer and Nelson’s analysis have changed and more research is needed to see how suppression techniques used in the 1950’s with 1950’s fuel loads and firefighting tools translates to today’s firefighter safety and effectiveness.

Beginning in 1994, the Naval Research Laboratory carried out a series of full-scale fire experiments to compare straight stream attack versus fog pattern attack. These experiments were conducted on the Navy ship ex-USS Shadwell with a fire volume of approximately 110~m$^3$. In these experiments one 60 degree fog pattern was applied at a 45 degree angle into the smoke layer. They examined cooling effects, steam generation and thermal layer disruption. Their experiments examined shielded and non-shielded fires and concluded that using fog to cool the upper layer was more effective and safer than straight stream attack when the fire could not be attacked directly and the firefighters heart rates and body temperatures were lower utilizing the fog attack.

In 1998 NIST conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate the suppression effectiveness of water-based firefighting agents. This was a step toward creating test procedures to determine suppression effectiveness to develop a standardized test method for evaluating the fire fighting effectiveness of water and other agents. This study provides preliminary data upon which firefighting effectiveness test may be developed by it suggests additional research on application technique, tests reflective of the complexities found in firefighting and experiments involving structural-fire suppression.  

In 2002, The National Research Council of Canada conducted a literature search on 3D water fog techniques for firefighting. It discusses the impact of water fog characteristics associated with properties of the nozzle (e,g,, droplet size, momentum, flow rate, spray angle and pattern) and discharge techniques (e.g., discharge angle, and discharge duration related to the burts) on performance of the 3D water fog technique are discussed. This technique is to supplement a direct attack by controlling the environment the firefighters are in until they are in a position to apply water directly to the fire. Opponents of flowing water into smoke have concerns that include: (i) effectiveness of controlling the fire, compared to traditional straight stream attack; (ii) possible disruption of the thermal balance; (iii) possible generation of a large amount of hot steam that produces burn injuries to firefighters; and (iv) the performance of this technique is complex and requires extensive training. Advocates of this technique have attempted to respond to these concerns but very limited experimental studies have been undertaken do to complexity of the problems. Application techniques and fire conditions on the the performance of fog technique is not well studied and therefore there are little guidelines and adoption will be greatly limited.

Several theoretical studies had been conducted that examine droplet size and their ability to suppress fire gases. For example, when droplet diameter is reduced from 1000 nanometers to 100 nanometers the total surface area increases 10 times from 6 m2 to 60 m2 for 1 liter of water. Since these smaller droplets evaporate sooner, others have examined the lifetime of the droplet to determine how far it can travel based on temperature of the surrounding gases and droplet size. Further complicating this theory is that droplets all have an impact on each other as they turn to steam. Residence time can be further reduced compared to an individual droplet, because leading droplets impart forward momentum to the surrounding gas, reducing the air drag on the following droplets and resulting in better penetration. In 2010, the University of Maryland examined spray characteristics from fire hose nozzles. They examined the breakup of a smooth bore nozzle utilizing techniques such as shadowgraphy and a patternator and concluded that more research was needed to fully understand the water spray from fire hose nozzles.  

In 2000, Lund University examined the demand for extinguishing media in manual firefighting. They examined critical flow rates required to suppress fires by reviewing available literature and conducted a series of experiments that examined suppression of wood pallets at a fire training academy. They examined the five ways that water can be applied during fire extiguishment, on hot gases, on flames, on burning fuel, on fuel that is not yet burning and on hot surfaces. They highlight that what is most effective against the fire is not necessarily best for the firefighters since there are other constraints during firefighting operations such as limited air supply and multiple priorities. The optimum flow rate corresponds to an optimum control time, a control time that gives the lowest total demand for resources. Most of the current data for optimum water flow rate include experiments utilizing wood cribs or pallets, but not todays synthetic fuel loads in actual structures.  These studies also did not investigate the effect of flow paths or the impact of steam generation on firefighters or victims.

In 2003, a fire service group at the Rockland County (NY) Fire Training Center conducted a series of tests in their concrete training building. They measured the amount of air moved by solid bore and combination nozzles using common fire ground methods. They concluded that air volumes moved by smooth bore nozzles and combination nozzles in the straight stream setting are very similar if not the same, and that combination nozzles in the fog pattern move significant amounts of air which can over pressurize the fire area and send steam over the attack crew even with a ventilation opening opposite the attack crew. These tests were performed either with no fire or with a training fire but which are very different than actual fire conditions. Their tests do provide a good range of airflows that can be expected in our experiments. The authors state, “Our nozzle testing program was not as controlled and as precise as we would have liked.” They also did not have measurement devices that were able to accurately measure air flows from a fog pattern.  

The Firefighting Technology Group at NIST has a current project that is examining hose streams. This project examines a variety of fire fighting hose stream characteristics related to flow, distribution and thermal impact from both solid and fog stream nozzles. A series of real scale, laboratory based experiments have been started to look specifically at the water discharge and distribution characteristics, the impact of hose streams on a hot gas layer in a compartment, the impact of hose streams on gas flows through multi-compartment structures, and the suppression effectiveness on burning piles of wooden pallets. The proposed project will build on their results by utilizing real-scale structures with common residential fuels and making additional measurements to better characterize the impact of flow path, nozzle technique and steam generation on fire dynamics, firefighter exposure and occupant survivability.

\chapter{Instrumentation}

Measurements of temperature, heat flux, pressure, and gas velocity were taken at various locations . For the ranch experiments, the same instrumentation was used throughout the duration of the study. The following describes the instrumentation used and potential uncertainty.

Heat flux measurements were made using a 2.54 cm nominal diameter water-cooled Schmidt- Boelter heat flux gauge (Figure \ref{fig:HeatFluxGauge}). The gauges measured the combined radiative and convective heat flux. For these experiments, the dominant form of heat flux is radiative due to the distance of the heat flux gauges from the flames. It should be noted that the convective contribution to the heat flux is dependent upon the surface temperature of the heat flux gauge. The manufacturer gives an uncertainty of ±3\% and results from a study on heat flux calibration found the typical expanded uncertainty to be ±8\% \cite{HeatFluxRoundRobin}.

\begin{figure} [H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 3.5in]{0_Images/Instrumentation/Heat_Flux_Gauge.jpg}
	\caption{Water Cooled Schmidt-Boelter Heat Flux Gauge}
	\label{fig:HeatFluxGauge}
\end{figure}

Temperatures were recorded using a bare-bead, Chromel-Alumel (Type K) thermocouple with a 0.5 mm nominal diameter (Figure \ref{fig:Thermocouple}). The uncertainty given by the manufacturer for the temperature measurements is ±2.2$^0C$ for temperatures below 293$^0C$ and ±0.75\% for higher temperatures \cite{TemperatureHandbook}. The thermocouple readings will be lower than the air temperature when the thermocouple is in the flame region, due to radiative losses to the surrounding cooler environment. When the thermocouples are farther from the flame region, the impact of radiation will result in temperature readings higher than the air temperature. Due to the effect of radiative heat transfer to the thermocouples, the expanded uncertainty is approximately ±15\%.

	\caption{Chromel-Alumel (Type K) Thermocouple}
	\label{fig:Thermocouple}
\end{figure}

To determine the gas velocity, an array of bi-directional probes was utilized in conjunction with differential pressure transducers and inconel thermocouples. The bi-directional probe was constructed of stainless steel and features a `high' side and a `low' side which travel back to a pressure transducer that evaulates the differential pressure from ambient pressure. The iconel thermocouples were placed in-line wtih the bi-directional probes to ensure that the measurements were recorded at the same location. The iconel thermocouple was a 0.063~in. diameter type KSL iconel 600 sheathed grounded junction with a type K, 24~gauge glass/glass insulation lead. The differential pressure transducer was a Setra Model 264 with a range of ±1.0~in. WC (±248.8~Pa). The uncertainty given by the manufacturer is 1\% or 1.2~Pa. The configuration had a velocity range of ±24.2~m/s (±54~mph). The pressure transducers were configured in groups of 6, contained in a single plastic box with connections for pressure, temperature and power (Figure~\ref{fig:Gas_Velocity_Measurements}a). Five probes were installed in openings where velocity measurements were taken, centered horizontally in the opening (Figure~\ref{fig:Gas_Velocity_Measurements}b). Velocity measurement with this configuration was determined to have an uncertainty of ±18\% \cite{BDPInPoolFires}.

Standard video was obtained through the use of BoschVTC-206F03-4 video cameras (Figure~\ref{fig:BullettCam}). Thermal imaging of the front and rear of the structure was taken using ISG Infrasys Elite XR (Figure~\ref{fig:IRCam}). The thermal imaging camera has a fixed emissivity value of 0.9 and was utilized for visual representation of relative conditions, no temperature measurements or analysis were derived using the camera. All cameras were recorded Samsung Model SRD-1680 DN digital video recorder set to 24 frames per second with a quality of ``high''.

Gas samples were analyzed through the use of OxyMat6 and UltraMat23 Siemens gas analyzers. Samples were pulled from the structure through the use of Cole Palmer Model L-79200-30 vacuum/pressure diaphragm pump rated at 0.75CFM via a stainless steel tube. The sample is filtered through a course filter, Solberg Model 842, 2 micron paper filter before running through a condensing trap to remove moisture. The sample then runs through a drying tube dry fine filter, Perma Pure Model FF-250-SG-2.5G with a 1 micron filter FF-250-E-2.5G before splitting into two branches and entering the UltraMat and OxyMat analyzer. The analyzers are calibrated to measure CO from 0-50000PPM, CO2 from 0-20\% and O$_2$ from 0-25\%.

All data was logged through the use of a national instruments data acquisition system incorporating a SCXI-1001 chassis with 8 SCXI-1102C 32-Channel modules (Figure \ref{fig:DataSystem}). The system is configured for a total of 256 channels capable of reading values between 0-10 volts DC. Values are recorded once a second and translated to quantities of interest through the use of LabVIEW software specifically programmed for use with the system. Data was sampled at 1~hz across all channels.

\chapter{Test Set Up}

\section{Structures}

The ranch fire experiments were conducted in two identical structures that were constructed in UL's Large Fire Test Facility in Northbrook, IL. The 1620 $ft^2$ houses were designed by a residential  architectural company to be typical of a single family home constructed in the late-20th century in the United States. The floor plan included 4 bedrooms, a bathroom, a living area, kitchen, and dining room. Three of the bedrooms were left open during the fire experiments, while one bedroom (Bedroom 3) was left closed, to examine the impact of a closed door on fire behavior. The interior of the house had 8' ceilings, and the rooms were separated from each other with walls and doorways. The floor plan of the houses used for these experiments can be seen in Figure \ref{figure:ranchexp1_floorplan}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{0_Images/Ranch_Pictures/Ranch_Floor_Plan.png}
\caption{Ranch Floor Plan}
\label{figure:ranchexp1_floorplan}
\end{figure}


Since the ranch fire experiments were intended to examine room and contents fires, and not structure fires, the walls of the fire room (Bedroom 1) and hallway were lined with two layers of gypsum board: a surface layer of 1/2'' board and a base layer of 5/8'' board. The remaining interior surfaces in the structure consisted of 1/2'' drywall. The exterior walls were covered with cement board to limit exterior fire spread. In Experiments 1 and 2, the floor close to the fire room and in the kitchen area was composed of cement board. The rest of the house was carpeted. For Experiment 3, the kitchen floor was composed of cement board, while the rest of the house was carpeted. The layout for Experiments 1 and 2 can be seen in Figure \ref{figure:ranchexp2_floorplan}, and the layout for Experiment 3 can be seen in Figure \ref{figure:ranchexp3_floorplan}.

\caption{Furnished Experiment Layout}
\label{figure:ranchexp3_floorplan}
\end{figure}

\section{Fuel Loads}
 In Experiment 1, the only fuel in the fire room was three wooden pallets and 1/3 bale of straw,  arranged in a ``teepee'' formation, as shown in Figure \ref{figure:Exp1_fuel}. The middle of the teepee was filled with 13 lbs. of straw.  Experiment 2 had an identical configuration of pallets and straw, but also included six  48'' x 96'' x 7/16'  sheets of OSB. Three of these sheets lined the wall behind the fire set, and three lined the ceiling above it, as shown in \ref{figure:Exp2_fuel}. In both of the training fuel experiments, the fire was ignited remotely with an electric match in the center of the teepee. In Experiment 3, the fire room was furnished to simulate a typical bedroom in a residential home. The fuel load consisted of a king-sized bed, dresser, TV, nightstand, pillows, 4'' foam mattress topper, 3 stuffed chairs (1 Yellow/Green Chair, 1 Red Lined Chair, and 1 Red Swirl Chair), curtains, carpet, and carpet padding.  The orientation of the fuel can be seen in Figure \ref{figure:Exp3_fuel}. The fire was ignited remotely  with an electric match in the seat cushion of the stuffed armchair at the side of the bed.

The furniture configuration in areas of the house remote from the fire room was identical for all three experiments. Since the furnishings in these areas of the house were remote from the fire, it was assumed that they did not contribute in any significant way to fire growth.  Bedroom 2 contained 2 stuffed chairs (1 Striped chair and 1 Red Diamond chair), a king-sized bed, dresser, nightstand, pillows, 4'' foam mattress topper, curtains, carpet, and carpet padding. Bedrooms 3 and 4 contained 1 stuffed chair (Yellow/Green Chair), a king-sized bed, dresser, nightstand, pillows, 4'' foam mattress topper, curtains, carpet, and carpet padding. The kitchen contained a kitchen table and 6 chairs. The living room contained a bookshelf with shelves line with a 5" foam mattress topper, 2 sofas, 1 stuffed chair (Yellow/Green chair) 2 ottomans, a coffee table, end table, lamp, TV, TV stand, large curtains, carpet, and carpet padding. The weights and dimensions for each elements of the fuel load are listed in Table \ref{table:fuel_weights}.

\section{Measurement Locations}

In order to collect the data needed for this analysis, sensors were installed and measurements were recorded throughout each structure. The measurement locations varied dependent on the structure and desired information.

\section{Equipment Utilized}

In order to ensure the data collected and associated results were applicable to the majority of the fire servce, our technical panel was tasked with creating a list of represetative nozzles, specified flows/pressures, and hose line techniques. All of these variables were tested during both the air entrainment and water distribution experiments; however, several other aspects were held constant such as the length of hose used. The nozzles utilized during these experiments can be seen in the table below.

\chapter{Experiment Analysis}

\section{Repeatability}
The experiments were grouped by the ventilation profile which existed prior to fire department interaction. The three ventilation profiles used were `No Ventilation', `Single Vent' and `Two Vent'. In the `No Vent' all the openings on the structure were closed until fire department intervention and the fire was located in bedroom 1. In the `Single Vent' a single window was open in the fire room (Bedroom 1) until fire department intervention. For the `Two Vent' there were two rooms of fire (Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2) and both the Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2 Windows were open prior to fire department intervention. To compare the effectiveness of the various fire service tactics used in the experiments it is important to identify if the experiments are comparable across ventilation profiles. 

Each set of experiments in the three ventilation profiles were compared in order to determine repeatability based on ventilation profile and thus the applicability of comparing the experiments. The comparison was done on average thermocouple array temperature. The temperatures in a period 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention were averaged both in time and across the thermocouple array. The following sections will discuss the results for each ventilation profile. 

\subsection{No Ventilation}
In the `No Vent' profile there were six experiments. The average temperate for the time period 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention is shown in Figure\ref{fig:repeat_No_Vent}. The gray area on the radar plot shows the measurement uncertainty for a thermocouple (+/-~\%15) at each measurement location based on the average of all experiments. With the exception of Experiment 1 the temperature is very repeatable under the `No Vent' case. In Experiment 1 the door ot Bedroom 3 was open, where in the other five experiments the door was closed. This accounts for the elevated temperatures in Bedroom 3 and at victim location 3 during experiment 1. All `No Vent' cases can be directly compared for all temperature measurement locations with the exception of Bedroom 3, where Experiment 1 is the out-lier and will not be used in the analysis.

\caption{Average Thermocouple Array Temperatures - No Ventilation}
\label{fig:repeat_No_Vent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Single Vent}
In the `Single Vent' profile there were 10 experiments. The average temperature for the time period 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention is shown in Figure \ref{fig:repeat_Single_Vent}. The gray area on the radar plot shows the measurement uncertainty for a thermocouple (+/-~\%15) at each measurement location based on the average of all experiments. All experiments were within the uncertainty of the measurement and thus are comparable. All `Single Vent' cases can be directly compared for all temperature measurement locations.

\caption{Average Thermocouple Array Temperatures - Single Vent}
\label{fig:repeat_Single_Vent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Two Vents}
In the `Two Vent' profile there were 8 experiments. he average temperature for the time period 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention is shown in Figure \ref{fig:repeat_Two_Vent}. The gray area on the radar plot shows the measurement uncertainty for a thermocouple (+/-~\%15) at each measurement location based on the average of all experiments. With the two rooms of fire and two ventilation points the repeatability decreased slightly from the other two ventilation profiles. Bedroom 2 grew at a faster rate than Bedroom 1, which reduced in some of the Bedroom 1 temperature averages being outside the measurement uncertainty. However the majority of the other measurement locations were within the measurement uncertainty making all `Two Vent' cases comparable.
