Outline for IFSI Report

1)	Pig Skin Data
	a)	Schematics and setup explanation
		i)	Information on Pig Skin and Neoprene
		ii)	Water bath and aluminum sheet described with CAD model
		iii)	Instrumentation at each victim location
	b)	Tests in the IFSI environmental chamber
		i)	 Radiative heat comparison
		ii)	 Convective heat comparison
	c)	Victim Packages and Locations
		i)	 Raw UL Pig Skin Temps
		ii)	 Discussion on general trends at each location
				(1)	Victim 1
					(a)	Representative plot
					(b)	Discussion
				(2)	Victim 2
					(a)	Representative plot
					(b)	Discussion
				(3)	Victim 3
					(a)	Representative plot
					(b)	Discussion
				(4)	Victim 4
					(a)	Representative plot
					(b)	Discussion
				(5)	Victim 5
					(a)	Representative plot
					(b)	Discussion
	d)	Overall Takeaways from data
		i)	Compare to gas temperatures
		ii)	 Comparison with heat flux (how accurate, where and why does it differ)
				(1)	Give a few representative plots
		iii)	  Spikes in temperature are observed after some water applications
				(1)	Spikes are small and only last 10-15 seconds, therefore no through thickness burns
				(2)	Temps between skin and neoprene never spike


2)	Water Concentration Data
	a)	Schematic and measurement information
		i)	Brief explanation on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and selection of wavelength
		ii)	Instrumentation and measurement location (bedroom 3 on the floor)
	b)	Experimental data
		i)	Plots of water concentration and obscuration for relevant experiments
		ii)	Discussion on general trends and obscuration issues
	c)	Overall takeaways from data
		i)	More water vapor is created by the fire then is created by the water application (at our measurement location)
		ii)	Compare the straw fire to a typical bedroom fire
