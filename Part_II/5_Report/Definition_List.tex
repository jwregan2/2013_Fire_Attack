\item [Pressure] \hfill
\begin{description}[leftmargin=!]
	\item Pressure is a measure of force per unit area exerted on a surface at 90 degrees to that surface. Values for pressure may be given in pounds per square inch (psi) or Pascals (Pa) The earth is surrounded by an atmosphere made up of approximately 78\% nitrogen, 21\% oxygen and 1\% of other gases.  The weight of these gases on the earth creates a force of 14.7~pounds per square inch (psi) at sea level.  This is referred to as Atmospheric pressure. Pressure in the fire service is typically referenced in the units of pounds per square inch or PSI, as this is the standard pressure unit for many of the pump panel gauges on an engine.  The pressure shown on the pump panel gauge is actually measured relative to the atmospheric pressure.  In other words, 50~psi is really 50~psi over the atmospheric pressure.  This type of pressure measurement is referred to as psi gauge or psig.   The pressure developed by the fire or by a fan is the measured pressure over and above the atmospheric pressure.   Fires create pressure that push smoke and gases throughout a room or structure. The pressures are very small, on the order of one thousandth of a psi.  Therefore it is best to use a different unit for measuring pressure. This unit is called a Pascal.  When it is written, it is abbreviated as Pa.  101,325~Pa equals 14.7~psi.  Or 1~Pa equals 0.00015~psi.
