\chapter*{Abstract}

TO BE COMPLETED ONCE COMMENTS RECIEVED AND INCORPERATED INTO FINAL DRAFT

% As research continues into how fire department interventions affect fire dyanmics in the modern fire environment; questions continue to arise on the impact and implications of interior versus exterior fire attack on both firefighter safety and occupant survivability. Previous research into various types of fire ground ventilation, flow paths, and exterior fire streams has provided the fire service with a more in-depth understanding of fire dynamics in addition to raising questions about certain fire attack methods stemming from differing traditions and myths. This knowledge gap and lack of previous research into the impact of fire streams has driven the need for further research into fire department interventions at structure fires with a focus on hose streams and suppression tactics. Statistics show that both firefighters and building occupants continue to loose their lives due to fire. As such, research into the various methods of fire attack will allow a broader understanding of how firefighter interventions on the fire ground can impact the outcome of both life safety and property protection. 

% This study will build and expand upon the fire research conducted to date by analyzing how firefighting tactics, specifically suppression methods, affect the thermal exposure and survivability of both firefighters and buidling occupants in addition to impacting fire behavior in structures. The project will be comprised of 3 parts:

\chapter*{Introduction}

The purpose of this study is to improve firefighter safety, fireground tactics, and the knowledge of fire dynamics by providing the fire service with credible scientific information on the impacts and implications of interior and exterior fire attack that is obtained from the results of water flow and full-scale fire testing in representative single family homes. Part I of the study is aimed at determining how water is distributed within a compartment, and Part II of the study attempts to quantify air entrainment by hose streams to provide insight into how different application methods; nozzle types and patterns; pressures/flows; and stream location and angle combinations move air inside buildings. Parts I and II were conducted without the presence of fire to gain a basic understanding of air flow and water flow before full-scale fire experiments were conducted during Part III of the study. These full-scale fire experiments were designed based on the results from Parts I and II of the study.

\chapter{Background}

Recent fire service research has highlighted the importance of applying water to the fire as quickly as possible. This tactical consideration has highlighted a knowledge gap and increased the interest in better understanding the impact of water applied as part of an interior attack or exterior attack. Many variables exist in fire attack that may have an impact firefighter effectiveness and victim survivability, including stream placement, the timing required to get water on the fire, stream type, stream movement, air entrainment, steam development, position of flow paths, and hot gas cooling and contraction. The fire service's most important tool for many years at structure fires is their hose line, however many questions have arisen as more research shows the impact of ventilation, flow paths and exterior fire streams. Whether a fire attack crew chooses to apply water as part of an interior attack or as part of an exterior or transitional attack they need to know what impact their stream has on the fire environment ahead of them. This is difficult on the fire ground because visibility is commonly limited and therefore all of their experience is from behind the nozzle. This results in beliefs about conditions (e.g., temperature), ahead of the nozzle and its impact on victim survivability but knowledge of actual impact has not been researched. Additionally, when the fire is ultimately suppressed that does not mean it was done most effectively, efficiently and safely but the experience gained suggests that it was. Fire service adages such as ``don't put water on smoke,'' ``you will steam the victims,'' and ``fog nozzles always disrupt the thermal layer'' have been passed on from generation to generation with little context or substantiation. Without the context these concepts get treated like rules and can severely limit firefighters understanding of fire suppression.

Fire training curriculum defines 3 fire attack methods, direct attack, indirect attack and combination attack. Direct attack involves the discharge of water directly onto the burning fuel. Indirect attack involves directing the stream toward the ceiling of a compartment in order to generate a large amount of steam in order to cool the compartment. Converting the water to steam displaces oxygen, absorbs the heat of the fire and cools the hot gas layer sufficiently for firefighters to safely enter and make a direct attack. Combination attack extinguishes a fire by using both a direct and indirect attack. Another technique to safely approach a fire that cannot be reached with a direct attack is gas cooling. Gas cooling provides a buffer zone around the attack team but the larger the compartment the less the impact on cooling the hot gas layer. Gas cooling must be a continuous process while advancing toward a shielded fire. Techniques for effective gas cooling and the upper limit of the volume where gas cooling is effective is not well known.  

In fire fighter training there is a lot of emphasis on steam generation but little is taught or demonstrated about the mechanics of suppression. Water vaporized in the upper gas layer reduces the total volume of the hot gases and steam. Water vaporized on hot surfaces such as the ceiling does not take much energy from the fire and therefore the volume of steam produced lowers the upper layer and makes conditions less tenable. These concepts are very important when the fire is not able to be directly attacked by applying water on burning fuel but is very difficult to visualize during a fire attack with limited visibility. Many of these fire suppression concepts are difficult to learn and refine because realistic ventilation limited fires are not safely replicated in firefighter training structures. Conditions created by todays fuels with heat release rates and smoke production properties commonly found in our structures are not allowed when following fire service training standards. Therefore the impact of hose streams in concrete training structures or metal containers can be misleading to firefighters resulting in incorrect inferences. This may then lead to inappropriate fire ground tactics with potentially deadly results. Research is needed to better understand the impact of hose streams so that proper messages can be taught in fire service training programs.

There are potentially harmful effects of inappropriate water application regardless of the type of hose stream. Since firefighters today are more aware of the need to cool hot smoke (fuel) in the upper layer, it is essential to understand the capabilities and limitations of each type of stream. The impact of hose stream application as one advances during a fire attack is dependent on a number of factors, principle of which are the flow path and where the steam is produced (in the hot gas layer or on contact with hot surfaces). Continuous application is likely to result in more steam being produced than gas contraction in the hot gas layer. Without ventilation in front of the hose stream, this can result in a reduction in tenability. However, when victims or firefighters are not in the flow path, and ventilation is in front of the hose stream, a combination attack can be quite effective for fully developed fire conditions.

Fire suppression effectiveness and firefighter safety are not achieved by water flow rate alone, but by appropriate use of a given flow rate under specific fire ground conditions. A flow rate must meet the critical flow rate to extinguish a fire depending on the heat release rate and should be higher to reduce the time to extinguishment. Drastically exceeding the critical flow rate has less impact on time to extinguishment but has a significant impact on the total amount of water used. There is little data to support that dramatically exceeding the critical flow rate results in increased firefighter safety. It has been estimated that only 5 to 10 percent of water applied during fire attack contributes to extinguishment. It is difficult for firefighters to realize the the efficiency of various hose stream techniques due to poor visibility on the fireground. However, by developing data in realistic structures, fuel sources, and fire scenarios, important inferences may be developed relative to different hose stream techniques, and use of water.

\section {Objectives}

The purpose of this study was to provide the fire service with scientific based knowledge on the impact of interior and exterior fire attack tactics on firefighter safety and trapped occupants to improve training and decision making on the fire ground. This was accomplished with the completion of the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve firefighter safety by increasing knowledge of fire behavior.
	\item Develop knowledge of water streams applied during an interior and exterior/interior fire attack and its impact on firefighter safety and victim survivability.
	\item Understand where water goes and how air flows during interior and exterior/interior fire attack utilizing common procedures and what that means to fire dynamics within a structure.
	\item Gain understanding of the impact of water streams depending on the volume of the fire compartment/structure.
	\item Advance the understanding of victim survivability in the modern fire environment by working with experts in the use of pig skin.
	\item Develop and implement a methodology to measure moisture content in the modern fire environmental conditions to answer fire service concerns.
	\item Bring the `Science to the Streets' by transferring science based tactical considerations founded on experimental results that can be incorporated into firefighting standard operating procedures.

% \section{Technical Plan}

% This study consisted of the following tasks shown in the figure below. Part I of the study details the specifics of the project related to the results from Tasks 7A and 7B. 

% \begin{itemize}

% \begin{figure}[H]

% \end{figure}

% \clearpage

% \item \textbf{Task 1 – Formation of a Project Advisory Panel}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Task 1 will bring together an advisory panel of technical experts in the fire service; and fire service research field. An open application process will be administered to find fire service experts in fire stream application and training in fire attack methods. Representatives from organizations including: CFD (Chicago Fire Department), FDNY (Fire Department of New York), IAFC (International Association of Fire Chiefs), IAFF (International Association of Fire Fighters), NVFC (National Volunteer Fire Council), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and career and volunteer representatives from urban, suburban, and rural fire departments will be invited to participate. Invitations will also be extended to representatives of major fire service publications and training material publishers. This well rounded panel allows UL to ensure their research is directed to the target audiences and that the end product of the research is able to be easily disseminated into practice.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \item \textbf{Task 2 – Incident Review}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Task 2 is to leverage our fire service advisory panel to conduct an extensive search to find examples of well documented successful and unsuccessful interior and exterior fire stream applications. This will be completed by monitoring fire service websites for videos and after action reports where there are defined flow paths and clear fire service fire attack actions. With approval of the fire department these incidents will be examined in detail to determine the impacts of fire stream type, flow, pattern and placement on the outcome of the incident, firefighter safety and victim injuries if applicable. Everyday the fire service is learning through their own experience and the experience of others through the means of sharing video. To make sure our experiments are tied in best with common fire service experiences we will identify trends in these incidents and tie the research results to the experience or beliefs gained from these incidents.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \item \textbf{Task 3 – Test Supplies, Instrumentation and Contractor Acquisition}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Task 3 will allow for UL to acquire research supplies and instrumentation to complete this project. Instrumentation includes thermocouples to measure thermal conditions that potential victims or firefighters would be exposed to, differential pressure sensors and bidirectional probes to measure pressure and gas velocity throughout the test fixtures, bullet cameras to capture interior views of the test fixtures to provide visual evidence of conditions. Other test equipment such as data loggers, gas analyzers, thermal imaging cameras and video cameras were acquired from previous studies and will be utilized during this study. A contractor will also be selected to construct the test house structures using construction practices representative of what would be found in most neighborhoods across the country.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \item \textbf{Task 4 – Develop Moisture Measurement Technique}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% During this task different commercially available moisture measurement technologies will be examined for their ability to make moisture measurements in conditions that will be created in the full-scale house experiments. These conditions include elevated temperatures and a high density of particulate. This measurement will allow for the ability to map where steam travels in the structure to assess the impact of steam on fire victims and on fire service steam burns.

% Several well established instruments exist to characterize the environmental conditions within a structure containing fires by measuring a variety of effluent gases along with temperature, heat flux and flow characteristics. However, the ability to measure moisture content in conditions applicable to describing fire environments, particularly after water has been applied to suppress the fire, is not presently available. The effect of measuring moisture at elevated temperatures is critical for hazard assessments for both firefighters operating within a structure and potential victims who are trapped in the structure. In the SFPE Handbook, Purser suggests that:  “… it is possible that the presence of water vapor may be an important neglected hazard in fires”, and, “Humid air, steam or smoke with a high thermal capacity of latent heat (due to vapor content or suspended liquid or solid particles) may be dangerous at temperatures of around 212~$^{\circ}$F (100~$^{\circ}$C), causing burns throughout the respiratory tract. It may be possible to predict the likely effects of hot-smoke atmospheres if thermal capacity or latent heat were measured.” 

% Thus, the ability to measure moisture concentration in such environments is a critical avenue of research for firefighter safety as well as to fully understand the impact of tactical decisions on trapped victim safety. It is of particular importance to know the moisture content in the rooms adjacent to the fire room at the level of occupants crawling on the floor (1~ft above the floor) or on furnishings (3~ft above the floor). Based on past experimental results, the temperatures observed at these levels in rooms adjacent to the fire room are typically under 400~$^{\circ}$F.  

% Commercially available moisture sensors have been developed recently for industrial process control, but these have not been studied for applicability to the live fire conditions. At the University of Illinois, Professor Dimitrios Kyritsis’ lab has advanced multiple techniques based on electrical and laser based measurements of gases during internal combustion engine operation that can be adapted to the sooty, dynamically changing live-fire environment. While there are a large number of techniques to measure moisture, most are inapplicable to the situation of high temperature moisture measurements in a combusting environment. Two techniques that could have use in these types of environments are infrared absorption techniques and electrical impedance techniques. There are two different methods to measure moisture using electrical impedance, resistive methods and capacitive methods. Both methods measure the relative humidity of the environment. Each method has its own set of advantages, with the resistive methods having a faster response time, while the capacitive methods can resolve relative humidity measurements all the way to 0\% RH. It is for this reason that the capacitive methods are most useful for this application, since at temperatures around 400 oF and volume percent of H2O under 10\%, the relative humidity will be under 1\% RH. Resistive methods do not accurately measure relative humidity under 5\% RH.  

% Absorption spectrometry is another possible technique for measuring moisture content in harsh, high temperature environments. Water has several absorption bands in the near-infrared range, which allows the use of tunable diode lasers to measure the moisture content. With proper thermal and optical control of the laser source and sample train such a technique should be operable at temperature exceeding 1800~$^{\circ}$F, be able to operate in and compensate for sooty and smoky environments, and have a very rapid response time on the order of seconds. Such approaches have been utilized to perform in-situ analysis from controlled combustion and process exhaust systems. However, due to the nature of the live-fire experiments studied here, an extraction technique may have to be implemented. Such techniques will be designed and tested at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign prior to the full-scale tests.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \item \textbf{Task 5 – Test Fixture Design}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Task 5 is the design of the test fixtures to be used in the experiments. The main test fixtures will be two single family residential home (1200 ft$^2$ single story ranch house) to be constructed in UL’s Large Fire Facility. This is the near the same design built for the three previous ventilation research grants and will therefore allow continuity of previous results to expand our knowledge. One of the main test fixtures will be altered to constructed an open floor plan so that gas cooling can be analyzed in different volumes. The test fixture will be furnished with contents that is representative of common households and refurnished after each experiment. Additional test fixture details are provided in the Appendix.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \clearpage

% \item \textbf{Task 6 – Design of Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Task 6 is the design of the experiments. In this task UL’s project engineers will work closely with the advisory panel to ensure fire service concerns are addressed and that the results will be of great benefit to the end users. All experimental variables, equipment, personnel, infrastructure and other resources will be evaluated to determine the best set of experiments to get the most for the investment and provide the largest return to the fire community. Variables such as types of nozzles, flow rates, nozzle patterns, ventilation parameters, timing of tactics, ignition location, and fuel loading will be discussed and selected during a technical panel meeting.  
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \item \textbf{Task 7 - Conduct Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \subitem \textbf{Task 7A:  Water Flow Mapping (Interior and Exterior Applications)}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip} 

% Methodology: Conduct a series of experiments in a compartment constructed to determine where water goes once discharged from fire department nozzles during a simulated interior fire attack and exterior fire attack. The ability to suppress a fire safely and efficiently is dependent on how much water absorbs energy from the fire and what surfaces are cooled. A combination of water mapping techniques that are commonly used for characterizing sprinkler sprays will be utilized to determine flow distribution. The compartment will be of similar size to the fire rooms in the full-scale fire experiments so that the results can be linked.

% Water will be flowed utilizing common fire department nozzles with 3 patterns (combination nozzle in a straight stream pattern, combination nozzle in a narrow fog pattern and a smooth bore nozzle pattern). Different nozzle techniques that are commonly taught to firefighters and utilized in practice will be evaluated such as circular motions, z patterns, flowing off the ceiling and flowing ahead. Common flow rates for each nozzle will be used during the experiments. We will also calibrate our remote water delivery method that will be utilized during Tasks 7E and 7F to distribute the water in a repeatable manner to what would be done by firefighters. Several experiments will be done in triplicate to examine repeatability.  

% Measurements: The actual delivered density apparatus (described later) will be used to determine water distribution, video cameras will be used to document the nozzle techniques and gross water distribution. Data from this Task will be analyzed and used to design the experiments described in Task 7E, 7F, and 7G.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \subitem \textbf{Task 7B:  Air Flow and Pressure Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Methodology: Conduct air flow and pressure experiments in the test fixtures prior to the introduction of any fire. Different hose streams and nozzle movement techniques entrain different amounts of air which can greatly impact fire dynamics, firefighter safety and victim survivability. The same nozzles, stream types and nozzle techniques will be used as Task 7A and the amount of air flow created and pressures generated in the structure will be measured. Different flow paths will also be established to see their impact such as having a ventilation point ahead of the hose-line and having no ventilation opening ahead of the hoseline. We will also examine air movement generated by 1 ¾ in., 2 ½ in. hand-lines and flows from master-stream devices (deck gun and ladder pipe).

% Measurements: During each of these experiments, velocities will be measured with anemometers and bidirectional probes attached to differential pressure gauges. Pressures will be measured with differential pressure gauges and HVAC air balancing measurements will be made. This data will allow for the analysis of air movement and its impact on fire growth measured in Tasks 7E and 7F.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \subitem \textbf{Task 7C:  Moisture Measurement Validation Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Methodology: The candidate moisture measurement techniques identified in Task 4 will be validated by this series of experiments. A bench scale apparatus will be designed and constructed that will allow the team to carefully calibrate moisture concentrations at temperatures up to 500~$^{\circ}$F and in the presence of potential confounders such as typical fire effluent gases and dense smoke conditions. A closed loop flow bench will be designed with a radiative heating element and moisture injection ports allowing adding controlled volumes of moisture to initially dry room air. These ports will also allow controlled metering of CO and CO2 as well as fire smoke effluent collected from live-fire burn experiments.

% Measurements: Moisture percentage will be measured and compared against controlled ambient conditions. Initial measurements will be made in a controlled environment with known temperature and moisture concentrations up to 500~$^{\circ}$F, (max 3~ft temperatures in bedrooms found in the Vertical Ventilation Study (source***)). After validation in these environments, a controlled concentration of potential confounders will be added to the test bench included typical fire gases (CO2, CO) and varying soot concentrations.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \subitem \textbf{Task 7D:  Pig Carcass Benchmarking Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Victims trapped within a structure face the risk of thermal burn injuries, particularly with unprotected skin. Suppression activities by the Fire Service can reduce this hazard by removing the heat source producing these dangerous conditions, however, the additional risks encountered by the conversion of water to steam must be studied. The risk for moisture related skin burns is likewise present for firefighters applying water to burning materials from inside the structure. While firefighting PPE provides a significant measure of protection, burn injuries are still a significant hazard during interior firefighting operations.

% The dangers of thermal injury from exposure to heat and products of combustion and time-temperature characteristics required for skin burns has been researched for several years. Typical studies involve exposing skin to a controlled thermal exposure and the time to an outcome, such as dermal or epidermal temperature changes or visual indications of damage. The synergistic effect of elevated temperature and moisture content on skin is conceptually understood due to the large latent heat and partial pressure of water at temperatures above 140~$^{\circ}$F. However, the effect of suppression tactics and the rapidly changing transient nature of exposure during this time frame (ambient temperature reducing, moisture content increasing) on risk for skin burns has not been measured in response to realistic fire suppression experiments. 

% Most commonly, porcine skin is used as a surrogate for human skin in burn studies (source**) as pig skin is more human like than any other readily available animal (source***). Furthermore, epidermal and dermal thicknesses for 3-4 month old swine are similar to an average human is estimated to be 70~µm, and 2-3~mm. Pig carcasses have been successfully utilized in place of live animal studies in part because the water loss from the skin of a live pig does not differ significantly from a carcass (source**).

% Methodology: In order to better understand burn injuries to both firefighters and potential occupants pig carcasses will be placed in various target rooms at different locations (1~ft and 3~ft from the floor) near the moisture sampling measurements during the house fire experiments. Pig carcasses will be obtained through the University Of Illinois College Of Veterinary Medicine after they have completed their research tasks at the University. The 3-4 month old pigs will be of similar weight and have skin thickness (epidermal layer ~60-80~µm, dermal thickness of 1-3~mm) that is comparable to human skin and can be analyzed as a surrogate for potential human skin damage. Prior to inclusion in the live-fire structure, samples will be exposed to varying levels of radiant and convected heat with controlled moisture content to establish a baseline for comparison of damage as a function of exposure.  

% Measurements: Thermocouples will be sewn onto the skin surface and under the pig’s dermal layer using sutures to measure temperature gradient and establish the time line for first degree (skin surface at 113~$^{\circ}$F) and third degree (sub-dermal temperatures reach 113~$^{\circ}$F). In the scenarios where sections of the pig will be covered by firefighting PPE, temperature and relative humidity (to measure penetration of moisture through the PPE) will be measured on the exterior and interior of the clothing in the same area. Using the instrument developed and validated in Task 7C moisture concentration will be measured in the immediate vicinity of the exposed pig. Skin damage will be well documented visually for comparison with the carcasses utilized in Tasks 7E-G.
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% \subitem \textbf{Task 7E:  Interior Fire Attack Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Methodology: A series of 12 full-scale house fire experiments will be conducted with simulated interior fire attack. The house will be furnished with modern furnishings and each experiment will have identical content.  A fire will be ignited in the master bedroom and the flow path will be altered to simulate scenarios that the fire department would arrive to or that would be created by fire department operations. The first 6 experiments will examine fire department arrival to a closed house with a ventilation limited fire. The front door will be opened creating a flow path. This will be repeated 5 times, utilizing 2 different hose streams, a controlled door, a coordinated ventilation opening, and once with no water application.  

% Five victim locations will be instrumented and the flow path the attack crew would be advancing through will be instrumented to examine conditions that the crew would be exposed to. The hosestream will be applied utilizing a monitor nozzle that will be able to advance on a set of tracks and will be programmed to flow the desired pattern and motion. The second set of experiments will add a second flow path by ventilating the master bedroom window. This will increase the size of the fire but will provide a low pressure point opposite of the attack crew. This will be repeated 5 times with two different hose stream patterns, two different hose line advances, and once with no water application until the front door flow path closes up and fire extends out of the front door. A third set of experiments will add a third flow path through Bedroom 2. Again 2 different hose stream patterns will be examined, two difference advances will be tested, and one experiment where no water is applied until fire extends out of the front door of the structure.

% Measurements: Measurements will be made to examine the fire dynamics in the test fixture, the exposure to firefighters in the flow path and to potential victims in several locations. The test fixture will be instrumented to measure temperature in every room, gas concentrations, pressure, gas velocity, thermal imaging and digital video. These measurements will allow for quantification of fire behavior, the impact of the water application and tenability for firefighters and occupants. Five victim measurement packages will be placed in the test fixture.  The packages will consist of temperature measurements at multiple elevations, gas concentration measurements (oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide), heat flux with water conditioned to 98 degrees to get more accurate heat transfer to skin, an instrumented pig carcass, a moisture measurement device and a video camera.

% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Methodology: A series of 6 full-scale house fire experiments will be conducted with simulated offensive exterior fire attack. A fire will be ignited in the master bedroom and the flow path will be altered to simulate scenarios that the fire department would arrive to or that would be created by fire department operations. The first 4 experiments will examine fire department arrival to fire extending out of the master bedroom window. Water will be applied through the window, utilizing 3 different hose streams. Five victim locations will be instrumented to examine conditions that they would be exposed to. The hose stream will be applied utilizing a monitor nozzle that will be programmed to flow the desired pattern and motion. The second set of experiments will add a flow path by ventilating the Bedroom 2 window. This will increase the size of the fire and will allow it to begin to spread into Bedroom 2. This will be repeated 3 times with three different hose stream patterns and once with no water application. A third set of 2 experiments will ignite the fire in the master bedroom and Bedroom 2 with both of their windows open (Figure 10). Once fire is extending out of both bedroom windows 2 different hose stream patterns will be examined by flowing water into the master bedroom window.

% Measurements: Same measurements as Task 7E, Interior Fire Attack Experiments.

% \subitem \textbf{Task 7G:  Large Volume Suppression Experiments}
% \normalfont
% \vspace*{\baselineskip}

% Methodology: A series of 8 experiments will be conducted that are the same as the first 8 interior fire attack experiments with the exception that all of the interior walls in the test fixture will be removed except for the walls to the master bedroom (Figure 11 and Figure 12).  This increased volume will allow for the analysis of gas cooling as a result of indirect attack in an open floor plan when the fire can not be accessed with the hose stream without crawling into the structure through the flow path. The fire will be allowed to develop until temperatures in the large volume would require an advancing attack crew to cool the upper gas layer in order to advance to the bedroom fire.  The advancing crew will be simulated just as in Task 7E so that the 2 configurations can be compared, compartmented floor plan versus modern open floor plan.

% Measurements:  The test fixture will be instrumented to measure temperature in every room, gas concentrations, pressure, gas velocity, thermal imaging and digital video. Four victim locations will be instrumented to examine conditions that they would be exposed to. These measurements will allow for quantification of fire behavior, the impact of the water application and tenability for firefighters and occupants. The data will be analyzed and compared to the compartmented measurements from Task 7E.

\section{Limitation and Scope}

This study looked at the impact the two main methods of fire attack, interior and exterior, have on victim survivability in residential structures. Due to the significant number of variables on a structure fire, limitations exist in the ability to evaluate them all. The variables selected were chosen to begin to bound the problem and provide insight into the practical application of fire suppression methods. 

These variables included house geometry, fuel loading, fire department arrival time, tactical choices, hose stream flow rates, and ventilation locations. The house geometry included a long residential hallway to evaluate the impact of approaching a fire down a hallway. Intervention times were based on arrival after ventilation limited fire conditions. By bounding these variables and controlling the test conditions during firefighting operations, it was possible to evaulate the impact of different fire suppression tactics on fire dynamics and conditions in two types of single family homes was examined.  

The study did not include differences in hose line deployments. The line was deployed to front of structure for first action, advancement through the front door or transitional attack through the front window and charged at the begining of each tactic.

Measurement of quantities such as moisture content and burn potential are difficult in the fire environment. This study advanced these measurement techniques however not all experiments were successful in recording usable data with regards to these two values. The experiments were data was obtained have been analyzed and used to develop tactical considerations where applicable. Future research, utilizing these measurement techniques is necessary to fully understand the impact specific fire suppression tactic. 

The fires in this study were content fires and represented a fire event within the living space of the home, and not a structure fire with fire extension into the walls or attic space.

The results of this study are applicable to single family residential homes and other residential occupancies with similar sized compartments with similar layouts. The tactical considerations developed are intended for similar size residential occupancies with similar compartment sizes. Further research is required for larger residential structures (in excess of 3,000~ft$^2$) or commercial occupancies.

\chapter{Literature Overview}

Hose, nozzles and water have been used by the fire service for hundreds of years. Despite their frequent use, there has been little scientific research conducted on the effective use of these tools for fire suppression. It is common in the fire service to find discussions about which nozzle is better or which flow rate is required for what sized fire but this is based on experience and usually not science. 

In 1950 Chief Lloyd Layman presented a paper titled “Little Drops of Water” at the Fire Department Instructors Conference. He introduced what he called indirect method of attack to suppress interior building fires by using the heat absorbing properties of expanding and condensing steam, produced in great quantities by fog streams. The conclusions were based on Coast Guard experiments that Layman was in charge of conducting at the Coast Guard Firefighting School at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, MD. Layman continued his experiments after he returned to his position as fire chief in Parkersburg, WV where he applied his tactic in building fires.  This research had a very large impact on the fire service and their suppression techniques to this day. 

Throughout the 1950’s a National Committee began conducting experiments to collect data on the growth and behavior of interior fires and how to most effectively suppress them. Keith Royer and Bill Nelson were members of this committee, and as the heads of the firemanship training program at the Iowa State University’s Engineering Extension, they collected and analyzed data from hundreds of experimental fires. Through this research the fire service was taught about fire behavior and how to suppress fire with a combination fire attack. They examined the amount of heat generated by common fuels, the heat absorbing capacity of water, the impact of compartment volume during suppression and they developed the Iowa formula. The Iowa formula or critical rate of flow formula is still used today and it determines the amount of water needed to control a fire in the largest open space within a structure by dividing the cubic foot volume of the space by 100.

While the physics of fire development has not changed over time, the fire environment for specifically the single family home has evolved. Several factors including home size, geometry, contents and construction materials have changed significantly over the past 50 or more years. Each of these factors has impacted firefighter and occupant safety. Faster fire propagation, shorter times to flashover, rapid changes in fire dynamics and shorter escape times all impact fire service suppression techniques and effectiveness. Many of the variables in Royer and Nelson’s analysis have changed and more research is needed to see how suppression techniques used in the 1950’s with 1950’s fuel loads and firefighting tools translates to today’s firefighter safety and effectiveness.

Beginning in 1994, the Naval Research Laboratory carried out a series of full-scale fire experiments to compare straight stream attack versus fog pattern attack. These experiments were conducted on the Navy ship ex-USS Shadwell with a fire volume of approximately 110~m$^3$. In these experiments one 60 degree fog pattern was applied at a 45 degree angle into the smoke layer. They examined cooling effects, steam generation and thermal layer disruption. Their experiments examined shielded and non-shielded fires and concluded that using fog to cool the upper layer was more effective and safer than straight stream attack when the fire could not be attacked directly and the firefighters heart rates and body temperatures were lower utilizing the fog attack.

In 1998 NIST conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate the suppression effectiveness of water-based firefighting agents. This was a step toward creating test procedures to determine suppression effectiveness to develop a standardized test method for evaluating the fire fighting effectiveness of water and other agents. This study provides preliminary data upon which firefighting effectiveness test may be developed by it suggests additional research on application technique, tests reflective of the complexities found in firefighting and experiments involving structural-fire suppression.  

In 2002, The National Research Council of Canada conducted a literature search on 3D water fog techniques for firefighting. It discusses the impact of water fog characteristics associated with properties of the nozzle (e,g,, droplet size, momentum, flow rate, spray angle and pattern) and discharge techniques (e.g., discharge angle, and discharge duration related to the burts) on performance of the 3D water fog technique are discussed. This technique is to supplement a direct attack by controlling the environment the firefighters are in until they are in a position to apply water directly to the fire. Opponents of flowing water into smoke have concerns that include: (i) effectiveness of controlling the fire, compared to traditional straight stream attack; (ii) possible disruption of the thermal balance; (iii) possible generation of a large amount of hot steam that produces burn injuries to firefighters; and (iv) the performance of this technique is complex and requires extensive training. Advocates of this technique have attempted to respond to these concerns but very limited experimental studies have been undertaken do to complexity of the problems. Application techniques and fire conditions on the the performance of fog technique is not well studied and therefore there are little guidelines and adoption will be greatly limited.

Several theoretical studies had been conducted that examine droplet size and their ability to suppress fire gases. For example, when droplet diameter is reduced from 1000 nanometers to 100 nanometers the total surface area increases 10 times from 6 m2 to 60 m2 for 1 liter of water. Since these smaller droplets evaporate sooner, others have examined the lifetime of the droplet to determine how far it can travel based on temperature of the surrounding gases and droplet size. Further complicating this theory is that droplets all have an impact on each other as they turn to steam. Residence time can be further reduced compared to an individual droplet, because leading droplets impart forward momentum to the surrounding gas, reducing the air drag on the following droplets and resulting in better penetration. In 2010, the University of Maryland examined spray characteristics from fire hose nozzles. They examined the breakup of a smooth bore nozzle utilizing techniques such as shadowgraphy and a patternator and concluded that more research was needed to fully understand the water spray from fire hose nozzles.  

In 2000, Lund University examined the demand for extinguishing media in manual firefighting. They examined critical flow rates required to suppress fires by reviewing available literature and conducted a series of experiments that examined suppression of wood pallets at a fire training academy. They examined the five ways that water can be applied during fire extiguishment, on hot gases, on flames, on burning fuel, on fuel that is not yet burning and on hot surfaces. They highlight that what is most effective against the fire is not necessarily best for the firefighters since there are other constraints during firefighting operations such as limited air supply and multiple priorities. The optimum flow rate corresponds to an optimum control time, a control time that gives the lowest total demand for resources. Most of the current data for optimum water flow rate include experiments utilizing wood cribs or pallets, but not todays synthetic fuel loads in actual structures.  These studies also did not investigate the effect of flow paths or the impact of steam generation on firefighters or victims.

In 2003, a fire service group at the Rockland County (NY) Fire Training Center conducted a series of tests in their concrete training building. They measured the amount of air moved by solid bore and combination nozzles using common fire ground methods. They concluded that air volumes moved by smooth bore nozzles and combination nozzles in the straight stream setting are very similar if not the same, and that combination nozzles in the fog pattern move significant amounts of air which can over pressurize the fire area and send steam over the attack crew even with a ventilation opening opposite the attack crew. These tests were performed either with no fire or with a training fire but which are very different than actual fire conditions. Their tests do provide a good range of airflows that can be expected in our experiments. The authors state, “Our nozzle testing program was not as controlled and as precise as we would have liked.” They also did not have measurement devices that were able to accurately measure air flows from a fog pattern.  

The Firefighting Technology Group at NIST has a current project that is examining hose streams. This project examines a variety of fire fighting hose stream characteristics related to flow, distribution and thermal impact from both solid and fog stream nozzles. A series of real scale, laboratory based experiments have been started to look specifically at the water discharge and distribution characteristics, the impact of hose streams on a hot gas layer in a compartment, the impact of hose streams on gas flows through multi-compartment structures, and the suppression effectiveness on burning piles of wooden pallets. The proposed project will build on their results by utilizing real-scale structures with common residential fuels and making additional measurements to better characterize the impact of flow path, nozzle technique and steam generation on fire dynamics, firefighter exposure and occupant survivability.

\section{Test Fixtures}

The ranch fire experiments were conducted in two identical structures that were constructed in UL's Large Fire Test Facility in Northbrook, IL. The 1620~ft$^2$ houses were designed by a residential  architectural company to be typical of a single family home constructed in the late-20th century in the United States. The floor plan included 4 bedrooms, a bathroom, a living area, kitchen, and dining room. Three of the bedrooms were left open during the fire experiments, while one bedroom (Bedroom 3) was left closed, to examine the impact of a closed door on fire behavior. The interior of the house had 8' ceilings, and the rooms were separated from each other with walls and doorways. The floor plan of the houses used for these experiments can be seen in Figure \ref{figure:ranchexp1_floorplan}.

\caption{Ranch Floor Plan}
\label{figure:ranchexp1_floorplan}
\end{figure}

Since the ranch fire experiments were intended to examine room and contents fires, and not structure fires, the walls of the fire room (Bedroom 1) and hallway were lined with two layers of gypsum board: a surface layer of 1/2'' board and a base layer of 5/8'' board. The remaining interior surfaces in the structure consisted of 1/2'' drywall. The exterior walls were covered with cement board to limit exterior fire spread. The kitchen floor was composed of cement board, while the rest of the house was carpeted.

\section{Fuel Loads}
Fuel loads were selected such that every experiment had the exact same configuration of fuel. The furniture was purchased from a wholesaler of repurposed furniture, where necessary items such as comforters, matress toppers, and pillows were purchased new to ensure the same fuel load for each experiment. The weights and dimensions for each elements of the fuel load are listed in Table \ref{table:fuel_weights}.

\section{Envirnoment Measurement Instrumentation}

Measurements of temperature, heat flux, pressure, and gas velocity were taken at various locations. For the ranch experiments, the same instrumentation was used throughout the duration of the study. The following describes the instrumentation used and uncertainty.

Heat flux measurements were made using a 2.54~cm nominal diameter water-cooled Schmidt- Boelter heat flux gauge (Figure \ref{fig:HeatFluxGauge}). The gauges measured the combined radiative and convective heat flux. For these experiments, the dominant form of heat flux is radiative due to the distance of the heat flux gauges from the flames. It should be noted that the convective contribution to the heat flux is dependent upon the surface temperature of the heat flux gauge. The manufacturer gives an uncertainty of $\pm$3~\% and results from a study on heat flux calibration found the typical expanded uncertainty to be $\pm$8~\% \cite{HeatFluxRoundRobin}.

\begin{figure} [H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 3.5in]{0_Images/Instrumentation/Heat_Flux_Gauge.jpg}
	\caption{Water Cooled Schmidt-Boelter Heat Flux Gauge}
	\label{fig:HeatFluxGauge}
\end{figure}

Temperatures were recorded using a bare-bead, Chromel-Alumel (Type K) thermocouple with a 0.5 mm nominal diameter (Figure \ref{fig:Thermocouple}). The uncertainty given by the manufacturer for the temperature measurements is $\pm$2.2~$^\circ$C for temperatures below 293~$^\circ$C and $\pm$0.75~\% for higher temperatures \cite{TemperatureHandbook}. The thermocouple readings will be lower than the air temperature when the thermocouple is in the flame region, due to radiative losses to the surrounding cooler environment. When the thermocouples are farther from the flame region, the impact of radiation will result in temperature readings higher than the air temperature. Due to the effect of radiative heat transfer to the thermocouples, the expanded uncertainty is approximately $\pm$15~\%.

	\includegraphics[width = 4in]{0_Images/Instrumentation/Thermocouple.jpg}
	\caption{Chromel-Alumel (Type K) Thermocouple}
	\label{fig:Thermocouple}
\end{figure}

To determine the gas velocity, an array of bi-directional probes was utilized in conjunction with differential pressure transducers and inconel thermocouples. The bi-directional probe was constructed of stainless steel and features a `high' side and a `low' side which travel back to a pressure transducer that evaulates the differential pressure from ambient pressure. The iconel thermocouples were placed in-line wtih the bi-directional probes to ensure that the measurements were recorded at the same location. The iconel thermocouple was a 0.063~in. diameter type KSL iconel 600 sheathed grounded junction with a type K, 24~gauge glass/glass insulation lead. The differential pressure transducer was a Setra Model 264 with a range of ±1.0~in. WC ($\pm$248.8~Pa). The uncertainty given by the manufacturer is 1~\% or 1.2~Pa. The configuration had a velocity range of $\pm$24.2~m/s ($\pm$54~mph). The pressure transducers were configured in groups of 6, contained in a single plastic box with connections for pressure, temperature and power (Figure~\ref{fig:BDP}). Five probes were installed in openings where velocity measurements were taken, centered horizontally in the opening (Figure~\ref{fig:BDP}). Velocity measurement with this configuration was determined to have an uncertainty of $\pm$18~\% \cite{BDPInPoolFires}.

Standard video was obtained through the use of BoschVTC-206F03-4 video cameras (Figure~\ref{fig:BullettCam}). Thermal imaging of the front and rear of the structure was taken using ISG Infrasys Elite XR (Figure~\ref{fig:IRCam}). The thermal imaging camera has a fixed emissivity value of 0.9 and was utilized for visual representation of relative conditions, no temperature measurements or analysis were derived using the camera. All cameras were recorded Samsung Model SRD-1680 DN digital video recorder set to 24 frames per second with a quality of ``high''.

Gas samples were analyzed through the use of OxyMat6 and UltraMat23 Siemens gas analyzers. Samples were pulled from the structure through the use of Cole Palmer Model L-79200-30 vacuum/pressure diaphragm pump rated at 0.75~CFM via a stainless steel tube. The sample is filtered through a course filter, Solberg Model 842, 2 micron paper filter before running through a condensing trap to remove moisture. The sample then runs through a drying tube dry fine filter, Perma Pure Model FF-250-SG-2.5G with a 1 micron filter FF-250-E-2.5G before splitting into two branches and entering the UltraMat and OxyMat analyzer. The analyzers are calibrated to measure CO from 0-50000~PPM, CO$_2$ from 0-20~\% and O$_2$ from 0-25~\%.

All data was logged through the use of a national instruments data acquisition system incorporating a SCXI-1001 chassis with 8 SCXI-1102C 32-Channel modules (Figure \ref{fig:DataSystem}). The system is configured for a total of 256 channels capable of reading values between 0-10~volts DC. Values are recorded once a second and translated to quantities of interest through the use of LabVIEW software specifically programmed for use with the system. Data was sampled at 1~hz across all channels.

At the University of Illinois, Professor Tonghun Lee's research lab has advanced multiple laser based measurement techniques to quantify production of gasses during internal combustion engine operation that have potential to be adapted to the sooty, dynamically changing live-fire environment. While there are a large number of techniques to measure moisture, most are not applicable to the situation of high temperature moisture measurements in a combusting environment.  Absorption spectrometry is capable of measuring moisture content in harsh, high temperature environments.  Water has several absorption bands in the near-infrared range, which allows the use of several classes laser based systems to measure the moisture content.  With proper thermal and optical control of the laser source and sample train this technique is operable at temperature exceeding 1000 $^\circ$C, can operate in and compensate for sooty and smoky environments, and has a very rapid response time on the order of seconds.  Such approaches have been utilized to perform in-situ analysis from controlled combustion and process exhaust systems.  The method used for these experiments was Tunable near-infrared diode laser to measure the water absorption peak near 1392 nm. Figure \ref{fig:Laser} shows the setup used in the experiments.

\section{Victim Package Instrumentation}

\subsection{Background}
Occupants trapped within a structure face the risk of thermal burn injuries, particularly with unprotected skin.  Suppression activities by the Fire Service can reduce this hazard by removing the heat source producing potentially dangerous conditions, however, the additional risks encountered by the conversion of water to steam must be studied.  The risk for moisture related skin burns is likewise present for firefighters applying water to burning materials from inside the structure.  While firefighting PPE provides a significant measure of protection, burn injuries are still a significant hazard during interior firefighting operations.

The dangers of thermal injury from exposure to heat and products of combustion and time-temperature characteristics required for skin burns has been researched for several years.  Typical studies involve exposing skin to a controlled thermal exposure and the time to an outcome, such as dermal or epidermal temperature changes (typically time to reach 44.8~$^\circ$C) or visual indications of damage. The synergistic effect of elevated temperature and moisture content on increasing risk for skin burns is conceptually understood to be due to the large latent heat and partial pressure of water at temperatures above 60~$^\circ$C.  However, the effect of suppression tactics and the rapidly changing transient nature of exposure during this timeframe (ambient temperatures reducing while the moisture content is increasing) on risk for skin burns has not been measured in response to realistic fire suppression experiments. 

An important objectives of the study is to better understand the influence of water application to a room and contents fire on trapped occupant exposure - particularly with respect to changing the risk for steam burns. Traditional measurement techniques utilized to estimate thermal risk (thermocouple to measure air temperature and heat flux gages to estimate thermal energy available to increase temperature of surfaces such as skin) are commonly utilized to estimate exposures through techniques such as the ISO standard fractional effective does (FED) tenability method.  However, there are some important limitations to this these techniques and assumptions must be made.  The impact of rapidly changing moisture conditions and the interaction of skin with radiation can have significant impact on the results.  In order to more accurately measure the impact of typical live-fire environment on human skin, an ex vivo porcine skin model was developed as a means of estimating the human skin exposure. Porcine skin has often been used as a surrogate for human skin in scientific study \hl{[Sheu; Douglass, Smith]}, due to the number of similarities between pig skin and human.  Utilizing this approach along with traditional fire estimation methods will hopefully provide new understanding of risks for trapped occupants and possibly provide a pathway for calibration of the existing tools to better estimate this risk.   

Human skin is the largest organ in the human body, providing important protective and heat transfer biological function.  The skin is comprised of several important components that are typically grouped in three distinct layers.  The epidermis is the outer layer of skin, comprised of dead cells and acts as the protective barrier to harmful environmental conditions such as moisture, ultraviolet radiation, and extreme heat \hl{[Hummel]}. Only part of the epidermis is effected in first degree burns and the dead cells flake off following the burn \hl{[Purser; Hummel]}. The human epidermis fluctuates based on body site and has been measured using ultrasonography to vary from less than 40~$\mu$m on the cheek and portions of the truck to over 350~$\mu$m on the fingertip [Whitton].  Typically ranges in thickness from 50~$\mu$m to 120~$\mu$m are reported \hl{[Sullivan]}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../0_Images/Instrumentation/Burn_Measurements/human_skin}
\caption{Cross Section of Human Skin}
\label{fig:inst_human_skin}
\end{figure}

The dermis is the second layer of skin which contains important living tissues such as blood vessels and nerve endings \hl{[Hummel]}. Second degree burn occurs when the damage reaches the dermis layer, completely destroying the epidermis \hl{[Hummel]}. Blisters can form in the area between the basal layer of the epidermis and dermis \hl{[Purser}. Like the epidermis, the human dermis fluctuates in thickness from less than 1000~$\mu$m to 4000~$\mu$m based on body site \hl{[Schaff; Hoffman]}.

When at least 75\% of the dermis has been destroyed and the burn extends to the subcutaneous layer, full necrosis has occurred resulting in a third degree burn \hl{[Purser]}. The subcutaneous layer is the deepest layer of skin and is comprised of fat and connective tissue \hl{[Hummel]}.

Domestic pigs are have been used for decades as surrogates for humans in experiments. The skin of a domestic pig is one feature that is similar to humans in many aspects such as thickness, structure, and composition \hl{[Moritz]}. Pig skin and human skin both have similar proteins, a sparse hair coat, a thick epidermis, a dermis with a papillary body, a deep layer of subcutaneous fat, and a large content of elastic tissue \hl{[Douglas]}. Normal pig skin varies by body site just as human skin does. The pig epidermis is described as ranging in thickness from 70~$\mu$m to 140~$\mu$m compared to the human epidermis range \hl{[Sheu]}. Due to the range of skin thickness throughout the body, a dermal-epidermal ratio ranging from 10:1 to 13:1 proves to be a better measure of thickness and is again, comparable in both pig and human skin \hl{[Sullivan]}.  It has been suggested that the structure of the pig's skin is so similar to that of a human's skin, that it may be a more superior model than that of nonhuman primate skin \hl{[Smith]}. However, there are important differences such as a lower water loss from pig skin at elevated temperatures and lack of blister formation that must be considered when using this model.

Moritz and Henriques conducted a series of experiments with both humans and pigs, such as creating contact burns at different temperatures and durations of time \hl{[Moritz]}. Through this experiment, it was discovered that irreversible damage will occur to the epidermis when the surface of skin reaches 44~$^\circ$C, although it can take long periods of exposure. Below this temperature, the rate of recovery exceeds the rate of damage due to burning \hl{[Donnely]}. The time required to create irreversible damage is reduced by about half with every degree increase between 44~$^\circ$C and 55~$^\circ$C \hl{[Donnely;?]}. Third degree burns can occur within one second of exposure once the skin reaches temperatures ranging from 57~$^\circ$C to 63~$^\circ$C \hl{[Donnely;?]}. Stoll and Green continued the work of Moritz and Henriques and discovered that the destruction of the skin does not only begin when the surface rises above 44~$^\circ$C, but continues as long as the temperature of the layer is about 44~$^\circ$C \hl{[Stoll]}. This means that the cooling phase also needs to be included in predicting methods \hl{[ASTM]}. Stoll et al. found that destruction rate can be modeled by the following first order chemical reaction rate equation.  With the use of this approach, burn injury becomes a function of the time and temperature that the skin exceeds 44~$^\circ$C. 

\subsection{Victim Packages}
A new method for estimating skin burn risk based on ex vivo samples of porcine skin has been developed. Figure \ref{fig:inst_SBA} shows the design and instrumentation of the victim package experimental setup. The victim package provides a transportable system for exposing skin samples to live-fire conditions in relatively repeatable conditions.  Up to 6 excised porcine skin samples (surrogate for human epidermal and dermal layers) are introduced on top of 10~mm thick neoprene rubber slab (surrogate for subcutaneous fat), which sit on top of a basin holding water at 98-100$^\circ$F (simulate the core of the body).  Each exposed skin sample was 10~cm x 10~cm to improve the applicability of a one-dimensional heat transfer scenario (through the skin as opposed to across the skin).  Neoprene was used for subcutaneous fat as it has similar thermal and mechanical properties as well as providing a uniform thickness. The thickness of the neoprene was used to simulate the thickest layers of subcutaneous fat. Strips of insulation were used to cover the exposed aluminum on the top of the plate and insulation was wrapped around the basin to help maintain the water bath temperature at human core body temperature.

\caption{Exploded CAD view of Victim packages}
\label{fig:inst_SBA}
\end{figure}

Type K thermocouples were attached to the surface of the neoprene layer to measure subdermal temperature using cyanoacrylate glue.  Furthermore, an identical thermocouple was placed in the center on the surface of the skin sample after it was deployed.  Additionally, thermocouples were also used to measure the temperature of the air surrounding the victim packages and to measure the temperature of the water bath during the test to ensure core body temperature was closely maintained.  Vertically oriented heat flux gages were deployed at each location to measure the thermal energy reaching the skin samples.  As part of UL’s instrumentation package, local measurements of gas concentration (O$_2$, CO$_2$, CO) were also measured at each of these locations.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sample Preparation and Victim Package Deployment}
Porcine skin samples were collected from research animals at the University of Illinois after they were euthanized for purposes other than this project. The dermal layer was removed from immediately from the carcass.  After transportation to the lab, subcutaneous fat was removed and the hair was shaved from the top layer of the skin using a razor. The sample was then placed in a plastic bag and stored in a freezer until the live-fire scenarios were to be conducted. Before being deployed into an experiment, the skin was thawed in the plastic bags using a water bath held at 37$^\circ$C one hour before the experiment began. After the sample was fully thawed, the skin was removed from the bag and its thickness was measured. The samples were then deployed to their locations and attached to the neoprene blocks using cyanoacrylate glue and surface thermcouples were similarly deployed. Damp towels were placed over the specimens to ensure they did not dry out prior to testing and heater and pumps were used to control the water bath temperature. Five minutes before the experiment began, the damp towels were removed and the structure was properly closed off. The temperature of the skin prior to the start of the experiment was typically between 82-92$^\circ$F.

For these scenarios, victim packages were deployed to 5 different locations throughout the structure (Figure \ref{fig:instruments}.  Locations 1, 4, and 5 were placed on the floor, while 2 and 3 were on top of a bed.  The bedroom door at the entrance to location 2 was closed throughout each scenario.

\section{Measurement Locations}

In order to collect the data needed for this analysis, sensors were installed and measurements were recorded throughout each structure. Figure \ref{fig:instruments} shows the location and numbering scheme for the instruments utilized.

\section{Equipment Utilized}

In order to limit the number of varriables, two nozzles were selected for use during the full scale experiments. Part I \cite{Weinchenk_watermapping} and Part II \cite{Weinchenk_airentrainment} of this projected highlighted that no statistical difference exhits between manufatuer in terms of air entrainment and rated flow. To most closely match the flow and pressure of a single smoothbore nozzle with a single combination nozzle the nozzles listed Table~\ref{table:nozzle_selection} were selected. 

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Nozzle Selection }

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Nozzle 		& Tip (in) 	& Nozzle Pressure (psi)	& Approximate Flow Rate (gpm) \\ \hline \hline

Combination & 	N/A 	& 	75 					& 150 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:nozzle_selection}
\end{table}

The nozzles were connected to 200~ft of 1 3/4~in handline. Pressure was set utilizing a in-line water filled pressure guage just behind the nozzle. Real time flow was measured with a 3~in electronmatic flow meter, connected prior to the 200~ft of handline. %as shown in Figure \hl{NEED A PICTURE OF FLOW METER}.

\section{Suppression Tactics Utilized}

The method of approaching a residential fire varies greatly depending on shift, department, state and region. It was not possible to test all the variations so the project techical panel was polled and the methods used by their representitive department/shifts were analyzed and grouped into three major methods. The three methods utilized were titled `Shutdown \& Move Advancement', `Flow \& Move Advancement' and `Transitional Attack'. Where experiments premitted slight variations, those variations were incorperated to understand their impact on the overall suppression tactic.

% \begin{table}[H]
% 	\centering

% 		Burst Suppression - "Check for Return" & Burst Suppression - "Check for Return" \\ \hline
% 		% Position at start of hallway and begin flowing & Position at start of hallway and flow from fixed position (5-10 sec) \\ \hline
% 		% Flow down hallway from close to far in a wall-ceiling-wall pattern while advancing until final room suppression & Flow from middle of hallway (5-10 sec) \\ \hline
% 		%  & Final Room Suppression at End of Hall
% 	\end{tabular}
% 	\label{Table:Tactics}
% \end{table}

\subsection{Flow \& Move Advancement}
The `Flow \& Move Advancement' incorperated moving the handline (advancing) while flowing water. This was not employed until the crew was in position at the start of the hallway, moving towards the fire compartment at the end of the hall. The tactic was conducted utilizing the following steps in order:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Front door open.}
	\item{Read neutral plane and conditions at entry door (10~seconds).}
	\item{Attack crew enters to a position approximetly 3~ft inside the door.}
	\item{Burst Supppresion - ``Check for Return'', crew flows a short burst of water at the ceiling.}
	\item{Attack crew advances to the start of the hallway.}
	\item{Flow down hallway from close to far in a `wall-ceiling-wall' pattern while advancing until arriving at the fire compartment.}
	\item{Without shutting down the line, attack crew applied water to the fire compartment.}
	\item{Once fire was `under control' the crew paused 1~minute to evaluate conditions.}
	\item{Attack crew entered the fire compartment for final suppression.}
	\item{All windows were opened for ventilation}
\end{itemize}

This tactic involved variation in the nozzle type (smooth bore, combination SS, combination fog) and use of burst suppression between experiments to evaulate the impact.

\subsection{Shutdown \& Move Advancement}
The `Shutdown \& Move Advancement' incorporated the same tactics as the `Flow \& Move Advancment' with the exception that the attack crew was not moving the handline (advancing) while flowing water. The tactic was conducted utilizing the following steps in order:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Front door open.}
	\item{Read neutral plane and conditions at entry door (10~seconds).}
	\item{Attack crew enters to a position approximetly 3~ft inside the door.}
	\item{Burst Supppresion - ``Check for Return'', crew flows a short burst of water at the ceiling.}
	\item{Attack crew advances to the start of the hallway.}
	\item{Flow from fixed position (5-10 sec) from close to far in a `wall-ceiling-wall' pattern.}
	\item{Advance to a positoin halfway down the hall.}
	\item{Flow from fixed position (5-10 sec) from close to far in a `wall-ceiling-wall' pattern.}
	\item{Advance to the fire compartment and apply water into the compartment.}
	\item{Once fire was `under control' pause 1~minute to evaluate effectiveness of tactic.}
	\item{Attack crew entered the fire compartment for final suppression.}
	\item{All windows were opened for ventilation}
\end{itemize}

This tactic involved variation in the nozzle type (smooth bore, combination SS, combination fog) and use of burst suppression between experiments to evaulate the impact. 

\subsection{Transitional Attack}
The transitional attack involved a initial exterior water application followed by interior suppression. The tactic was conducted utilizing the following steps in order:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Exterior water application into the fire compartment.}
	\item{Approach compartment and wet surfaces (Not during all experiments)}
	\item{Reposition handline to front door}
	\item{Front door open.}
	\item{Attack crew enters, flows water to cool as they approach, if necessary.}
	\item{Apply water to the fire compartment, if necesary}
	\item{Once fire was `under control' pause 1~minute to evaluate effectiveness of tactic.}
	\item{Attack crew entered the fire compartment for final suppression.}
	\item{All windows were opened for ventilation}
\end{itemize}

This tactic involved variation in the nozzle type (smooth bore, combination SS, combination fog), if a secondary exterior application was conducted (second room of fire), flow on the advancment down the hallway and need for application of water into the fire comparment from the interior. 

\chapter{Full-Scale Residential Fire Experiments}

In order to examine different fire attack techniques, twenty-five experiments were conducted in the full-scale residential structure described in Chapter~\ref{chap:exp_config}. Experiments~1--17 were focused on studying interior fire attack methods, and the remaining eight experiments were focused on studying exterior fire attack methods. Three different configurations were used throughout all 25 experiments: `No Vent', `Single Vent', and `Two Vent'. These configurations along with the details of each individual experiment are described in the following sections.  

Fire intervention times were based on conditions within the fire compartment(s) to ensure repeatable conditions and comparability of experiments. For experiments where no ventilation was provided, the point at which the fire became ventilation limited and temperatures began to decrease was the point where intervention began. For experiments where the window was open prior to ignition, the point at which the fire reached a steady ventilation limited state was the time intervention began.

\subsubsection{Experiment 1}
Experiment~1 looked at the fire dynamics in a typical single-story structure with delayed water application. The fire was ignited in Bedroom~1 and allowed to develop until it became ventilation limited. Then, the front door was opened to simulate fire department arrival. The open door established a flow path between itself and Bedroom~1. Once the fire reached steady state, suppression was performed via the front door with a combination nozzle on straight stream. The nozzle was shutdown as the line advanced.

\subsubsection{Experiment 13}
Experiment 13 looked at the fire dyamics of a 2-bedroom fire in a single-story structure where suppression is conducted with a solid stream pattern. The fire is ignited simultaneously in Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2. The fire develops and becomes ventilation limited. Once this happens, the front door is opened, simulating fire department arrival. These actions create flow paths between the front door and each fire bedroom and between each bedroom window and the fire bedrooms. An interior fire attack is initiated through the front door, utilizing a solid stream pattern. Water will be flowing while the hose line is advanced.

Experiment 24 looked at the fire dyamics of a 2 bedroom fire in a single-story structure with exterior suppression. The fire is ignited simultaneously in Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2. As the fire develops, it transitions to a ventilation limited fire. Soon after the fire becomes ventilation limited, exterior suppression will be initiated using a straight stream pattern followed by content suppression. Interior attack will be used for full extinguishment. Figure~\ref{fig:Two_Vent_ext} shows the configuration of the structure and Table~\ref{Table:Exp24Interventions} shows at what times interventions were performed. The results of Experiment 24 can be found in Appendix~\ref{App:Exp24Results}. To view the full experiment video \href{https://player.vimeo.com/video/170499626?autoplay=1}{Click Here}.

\section{Large Volume Gas Cooling}
During Experiment 25 all of the interior walls of the structure with the exception of Bedroom 1 `D' side wall. Gas cooling in a large volume was utilized on a fire which could not be directly supressed. This configuration, presented in Figure~\ref{fig:Gas_Cooling}, consisted of a fire in Bedroom~1 with the Bedroom 1 window and front door open, all other vents remainded closed.

\label{fig:Gas_Cooling}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Experiment 25}
This experiment aimed to examine gas cooling through a challenging configuration. In the previous experiments there was a well compartmented house that limited the fire growth and fire gas flow based on ventilation to the fire room via the open window and doorway.  The doorway connected to a long hallway which connected to the front door through the living room.  To create a larger volume of hot gases all of the interior walls of the structure with the exception of Bedroom 1 `D' side wall.  The one wall was left in place so that water could not be applied directly to the contents on fire and only the hot gases.  The fuel load consisted of 2 chairs, 2 ottomans, 2 king sized mattresses and box springs, 8 rolls of carpet padding and 5 rolls of carpet.  One half of the bedroom window was left open the entire experiment to provide oxygen to maintain a ventilation limited fire.  The front door also remained open for the duration of the fire.  Thermocouples trees in 4 locations monitored temperatures from floor to ceiling.  A vertical 2~in by 6~in support, with cement board protection was placed in front of each thermocouple array so that water could not directly contact the array and the hose stream could not knock the arrays down.  

We were trying to answer the question, can you cool the gases enough to be able to move into the structure far enough to get water directly onto the burning fuel load?  In this scenario that is just past the 2TC location.

 Figure~\ref{fig:Gas_Cooling} shows the configuration of the structure and Figure~\ref{fig:Exp_25_Images} shows the interior of the structure. Table~\ref{Table:Exp25Interventions} shows at what times interventions were performed. The results of Experiment 25 can be found in Appendix~\ref{App:Exp25Results}.

\chapter{Experiment Analysis}

\section{Repeatability}
The experiments were grouped by the ventilation configuration which existed prior to fire department interaction. The three ventilation configuration used were `No Vent', `Single Vent' and `Two Vent'. In the `No Vent', all the openings on the structure were closed until fire department intervention, and the fire was located in Bedroom 1. In the `Single Vent', a single window was open in the fire room (Bedroom 1) until fire department intervention. For the `Two Vent' there were two rooms of fire (Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2), and the window in each room was open prior to fire department intervention. To compare the effectiveness of the various fire service tactics used in the experiments, it is important to identify if the experiments are comparable across ventilation configurations. 

Each set of experiments in the three ventilation congiruations were compared to determine repeatability based on ventilation configuration and thus, the applicability of comparing the experiments. The comparison was based on the average temperature measured by the thermocouples in each thermocouple array. The average temperature from each thermocouple array was time-averaged along the period of 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention. In the following sections, the results for each ventilation configuration are presented and discussed. 

\subsection{No Vent}
A total of six experiments contained the `No Vent' ventilation configuration. The average temperature measured by each thermocouple array averaged across the duration of 60 seconds before fire department intervention is shown in the radar plot presented in Figure~\ref{fig:repeat_No_Vent}. The gray area on the radar plot represents the uncertainty range ($\pm$15~\%) associated with the thermocouple temperature measurement at each measurement location based on the average of the six experiments. With the exception of two instances from Experiment~1, the averaged temperatures are within the gray area and thus, are repeatable for the `No Vent' ventilation configuration. 

During Experiment~1, the door to Bedroom 3 was open, while during the other five experiments, the door to Bedroom~3 was closed. The open door accounts for the Experiment~1 temperatures that are outside the uncertainty range: the temperatures at the Victim 3 location and at the Bedroom 3 array location. The temperature measurement locations from all `No Vent' cases can be directly compared with the exception of the Bedroom 3 and Victim 3 locations during Experiment 1, which were outliers and as a result, will not be used in the analysis.

\caption{Average Thermocouple Array Temperatures - No Ventilation}
\label{fig:repeat_No_Vent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Single Vent}
In the `Single Vent' profile, there were 10 experiments. The average temperature for the time period 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention is shown in Figure \ref{fig:repeat_Single_Vent}. The gray area on the radar plot shows the measurement uncertainty for a thermocouple ($\pm$15~\%) at each measurement location based on the average of all experiments. All experiments were within the uncertainty of the measurement and thus, are comparable. All `Single Vent' cases can be directly compared for all temperature measurement locations.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Repeatibility/Single_Vent}
\caption{Average Thermocouple Array Temperatures - Single Vent}
\label{fig:repeat_Single_Vent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Two Vents}
In the `Two Vent' profile, there were 8 experiments. The average temperature for the time period 60 seconds prior to fire department intervention is shown in Figure \ref{fig:repeat_Two_Vent}. The gray area on the radar plot shows the measurement uncertainty for a thermocouple ($\pm$15~\%) at each measurement location based on the average of all experiments. With the two rooms of fire and two ventilation points, the repeatability decreased slightly from the other two ventilation configuration. Bedroom 2 grew at a faster rate than Bedroom 1, which reduced in some of the Bedroom 1 temperature averages being outside the measurement uncertainty. However, the majority of the other measurement locations were within the measurement uncertainty making all `Two Vent' cases comparable.

\section{Victim Survivability \& Tenability}
The survivability of a particular fire scenario is difficult to quantify. Factors such as age, gender, and overall health all play a role in how an individual responds to the environment found inside a structure fire. Correlations exist for estimating the threshold from heat energy that would result in a fatality for fifty percent of the general population. Additional correlations exist for irritant and toxic gases however, they focus more on tenability (the dose required for the potential occupant to become incapacitated) and not on survivability (the dose required to cause a fatality). Although it is possible to estimate the survivability based on temperature alone and the tenability based on gas concentrations, no reliable method exists to estimate the combined effects of both temperature and toxic gases. \cite{SFPE:Purser}

Both temperature exposure and toxic gas exposure can be quantified through the use of a Fractional Effective Dose (FED) concept where the FED is equal to the dose received in a given time divided by the effective dose required for a desired endpoint be it incapacitation or death. 

\begin{equation}
	FED = \frac{\text{Dose received at time } t(Ct)}{\text{Effective } Ct \text{ dose to cause incapacitation or death}}
	\label{FED_general}
\end{equation} 

The fractional from carbon monoxide exposure can be calculated as shown in equation \ref{FED_gas} \cite{SFPE:Purser}. The total FED is the integral over the time of exposure $t_1$ to $t_2$ of $3.17 \times  10^{-5}$ multiplied by $CO$, the carbon monoxide concentration in ppm, multiplied by $V$, the volume of air breathed per minute, all divided by $D$ the exposure dose of percent carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) for incapacitation, multiplied by the time step. For this analysis a value of $25~L/min$ was used for $V$, for a victim walking to escape, and a value of 30~\% (COHb) for $D$ for an incapacitating dose.

\begin{equation}
	FED = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\left(\frac{3.17 \times 10^{-5} \left(CO\right)^{1.036} \left(V\right)}{D}\right) \Delta t
	\label{FED_gas}
\end{equation}

Two methods exist for estimating the effective dose of heat energy received over time, one based on gas temperature and one based on the total heat flux. The method based on total energy flux is the integral from the start of exposure $t_1$ to the end of exposure $t_2$ of the exposure $q$ at time $t$ to the four thirds power, divided by $r$ the heat exposure dose for the endpoint of fatality, $16.7(\sfrac{kW}{m^2})^{\sfrac{4}{3}}$, all multiplied by the exposure time step $\Delta t$ in minutes. \cite{SFPE:Purser}

\begin{equation} \label{TotalFlux_FED}
	FED = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left( \frac{q^{4/3}}{r} \right) \Delta t
\end{equation}

The method based on gas temperature as show in equation \ref{GasTemp_FED} is the the integral from the start of exposure $t_1$ to the end of exposure $t_2$ of the gas temperature $T$ in $^{\circ}C$ at time $t$ to the $-9.0403$ power, multiplied by $\num{2e18}$ added to the gas temperature $T$ in $^{\circ}C$ at time $t$ to the $-3.10898$ power multiplied by $\num{e8}$ all multiplied by the time step $\Delta t$ in minutes. \cite{SFPE:Purser}

\begin{equation} \label{GasTemp_FED}
	FED = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left( \num{2e18} \times T^{-9.0403} + \num{e8} \times T^{-3.10898} \right) \Delta t
\end{equation}

To determine survivability and tenability a package of sensors were utilized to simulate victims at five different locations within the structure as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:vic_loc}. Victim 1 was located at the end of the hall outside the fire room(s); Victim 2 was located on the bed in Bedroom 3 where the bedroom door was closed; Victim 3 was located on the bed in Bedroom 4 where the bedroom door was open; Victim 4 was located in the Living room near the entrance to the hall; and Victim 5 was located as remote from the fire room(s) as possible in the back right corner of the Dining room. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../0_Images/Instrumentation/Victim_Locations}
	\caption{Victim Locations}
	\label{fig:vic_loc}
\end{figure}

Each location included an array of thermocouples at 1~ft, 3~ft, 5~ft and 7~ft above the floor and schmidt-bloter total heat flux gauge oriented such that the view range of the gauge was directed vertically at 1~ft above the floor. Victims 1-4 had a gas measurement point analyzing carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) and oxygen (O$_{2}$) located 1~ft above the floor. In addition to the sensors, instrumented pig skins were utilized to simulate human skin at each victim location. Figure \ref{fig:vic_package} shows an example of a victim package. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5in]{../0_Images/Instrumentation/Victim_Package}
	\caption{Example victim package.}
	\label{fig:vic_package}
\end{figure}

The CO, CO$_{2}$, and O$_{2}$ values from the gas analyzers were utilized in equation \ref{FED_gas} to determine the fraction of dose required for untenability. A value of 1 represents untenable and a value of 3 represents a potentially fatal dose. The gas temperature recorded via the 1~ft thermocouple was used in equation \ref{GasTemp_FED} to determine the fraction of a fatal dose received via convective heat transfer, where a value of 1 is equivalent to a fatal dose in 50~\% of the population. The total heat flux recorded at the  schmidt-bolter heat flux gauge was used in equation \ref{TotalFlux_FED} to determine the fraction of a fatal dose received via both convective and radiative heat transfer, where a value of 1 is equivalent to a fatal dose in 50~\% of the population, .  

This section will analyze the experiments conducted for survivability of the five victim locations shown in  based on temperature an tenability based on gas concentrations in the period prior to fire department arrival and then as they relate to the possible fire suppression tactics. 

\subsection{Prior To Fire Department Arrival}
To examine the potential survivability and tenability prior to fire department intervention the experiments were grouped by the available ventilation. The average fractional effective dose over time was calculated for each victim location along with the value of one standard deviation. The earliest intervention of the group of experiments was used as the initial intervention time in order to remain consistant with regards to exposure time.

\subsubsection{No Ventilation}

Figure \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-No_Vent} represents the no ventilation configuration where all exterior windows/doors were closed. The fire was located in Bedroom 1 and fire department intervention occurred at 6~minutes and 58~seconds, after the fire reached a ventilation limited state . 

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

 Figure \ref{fig:FED_NoVent} illistrates the average fractional effective dose over time at each of the victim locations relative to toxic gases, convective heat transfer and both radative and convective heat transfer. The shaded areas represent +/- one standard deviation from the average value with the shaded color corresponding to the victim location.

	\label{fig:FED_NoVent}
\end{figure}

\hl{NEED TO EVALUTE CONVECTIVE FED AT 3FT FOR STEVE}

With regards to the toxic gases both survivability and tenability are related to the elevation in the space, along with the proximity to the fire. Victim 3 located on the bed in the open bedroom, once the smoke layer reached the victim the FED increased rapidly, exceeding an FED of 3 between 5~min 30~sec and 6~min 30~sec. The smoke took significantly longer to reach Victims located at the floor level, resulting in a lower FED at the time of fire department arrival. Victim 4 being more remote to the fire shows a higher FED than victim 1 near the fire as the flow path carried the smoke to the floor level in the remote locations first as the ambient air was drawn back to the fire keeping Victim 1 in the ambient air longer. 

The survivability in terms of heat energy is driven more by the radiative energy transfer than the convective. The FED based strictly on convective transfer shows almost no increase prior to fire department arrival. When both radiative and convective heat transfer are examined, all of the victim locations are below the threshold for fatality in 50~\% of the population. Victim 1, was shown to have the highest FED value due to the proximity of the fire followed by the victim 3 location which is within the hot gas layer. For the remainder of the locations FED was driven by the proximity to the fire where victim 4 was closer than victim 5. The effectiveness of a closed bedroom door is illustrated by the victim 2 location value being the lowest. 

\subsubsection{Single Window Vent}

Figure \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-Single_Vent} represents the ventilation configuration where all exterior windows/doors were closed with the exception of the bedroom 1 window. The fire was located in bedroom 1 and fire department intervention occurred  at 5~minutes and 26~seconds, after the fire reached a flashover. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{../0_Images/Ventilation_Configurations/Single_Vent.png}
	\caption{Ventilation Configuration - Single Window Vent (Experiments 7-12 \& 18-21)}
	\label{fig:Vent_Profile-Single_Vent}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FED_SingleVent} illustrates the average fractional effective dose over time at each of the victim locations relative to toxic gases, convective heat transfer and both radative and convective heat transfer. The shaded areas represent +/- one standard deviation from the average value with the shaded color corresponding to the victim location. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/FED/FED_Avg_Gas/Single_Vent}
	\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/FED/FED_Avg_Temp_Conv/Single_Vent}

Upper left chart is based on gas concentration, upper right chart is based on convective heat transfer and bottom chart is based on both convective and radiative transfer.}
	\label{fig:FED_SingleVent}
\end{figure}

The fire department intervention was preformed in just over 5~minutes limiting the time available for the gases too reach the victim locations. This resulted in an FED from toxic gases at the time of intervention which indicates a tenable and survivable space at each location. The FED at the victim 3 location began to increase just before intervention, indicating the time to untenability and fatality is approaching. 

The survivability in terms of heat energy was also less due to the decreased duration of exposure. It was driven more by the radiative energy transfer than the convective. The FED based strictly on convective transfer shows almost no increase prior to fire department intervention. When both radiative and convective heat transfer are examined, all of the victim locations are below the threshold for fatality in 50~\% of the population. The victim 1 location, had the highest FED value due to the proximity of the fire however the other four locations show almost no FED. 

\subsubsection{Two Window Vents, Two Rooms of Fire}

Figure \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-Two_Vent} represents the ventilation configuration where all exterior windows/doors were closed with the exception of the bedroom 1 and bedroom 2 windows. The fire was located in both bedroom 1 and bedroom 2. Fire department intervention occurred at 5~minutes and 24~seconds, after the fire reached a flashover. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{../0_Images/Ventilation_Configurations/Two_Vent.png}
	\caption{Ventilation Configuration - Single Window Vent (Experiments 13-17 \& 22-24)}
	\label{fig:Vent_Profile-Two_Vent}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FED_TwoVent} illustrates the average fractional effective dose over time at each of the victim locations relative to toxic gases, convective heat transfer and both radiative and convective heat transfer. The shaded areas represent +/- one standard deviation from the average value with the shaded color corresponding to the victim location. 

\begin{figure}[H]

Upper left chart is based on gas concentration, upper right chart is based on convective heat transfer and bottom chart is based on both convective and radiative transfer.}
	\label{fig:FED_TwoVent}
\end{figure}

The tenability and survivability based on toxic gas was again driven by the elevation in the space. With two rooms of fire and two ventilation openings the victim 3 location on the bed in the open bedroom exceeded a FED of 3 in just under 5~minutes. The smoke took longer to reach the 1~ft level, thus all other victim locations show almost no increase in FED at fire department intervention.

The survivability in terms of heat energy was driven more by the radiative energy transfer than the convective. The FED based strictly on convective transfer shows a fatal dose of energy in just over three minutes at the victim 1 location and no increase prior to fire department intervention at the remainder of the 4 victim locations. When both radiative and convective heat transfer are examined, the victim 1 location receives a fatal dose in just under 3~minutes 30~seconds. After that point the FED is driven by the elevation in the space with locations in the hot gas layer receiving more FED than those at the floor. After the 5~minute mark all victim locations are receiving a thermal FED with the exception of the victim 2 location behind the closed door.  

\subsubsection{FED Ventilation Comparison}
When comparing the FED for the three ventilation cases it is important to consider both the size of the fire and the timing. Although it may appear initially the case with no ventilation resulted in higher FED values, however that is because it involved a greater duration. Three experiments were conducted with delayed water application to determine evaluate the effect of delayed water. 

A comparison of the FED for each victim location is shown in Figure \ref{fig:FED_Base} where a FED of 1.0 for the thermal values of convective and total flux represents the lethal concentration for 50~\% of the population (LC50) and  a FED of 1.0 for the toxic gases represents a untenable condition where occupants would not be able to self rescue. 

Experiment 1 had no ventilation, see figure \ref{fig:FED_NoVent} for the ventilation configuration. The front door was opened at 8~minutes 17~seconds. Experiment 12 had the bedroom 2 window open, see figure \ref{fig:FED_SingleVent} for the the ventilation configuration. The front door was opened at 5~minutes and 57~seconds. Experiment 17 had two rooms a fire in bedroom 1 and bedroom 2 with both bedroom windows open, see figure \ref{fig:FED_TwoVent} for the ventilation configurationF. The front door was opened at 5~minutes and 27~seconds. 

The 'Total Flux' value refers to the FED calculated from equation \ref{TotalFlux_FED}, the 'Convective' value refers to the FED calculated from equation \ref{GasTemp_FED} and the 'Toxic Gas' value refers to the FED calculated from equation \ref{GasTemp_FED}.

	\label{fig:FED_Base}
\end{figure}

Victim location 1 shows that the in the two vent case the thermal hazard is the most significant, for the no vent case it is the toxic gases. In the victim 2 case, being behind the closed door provides a survivable and tenable atmosphere. At the victim 3 location the driving hazard is the toxic gases which accumulate first for the two room fire, followed by the no vent case and lastly by the event case. In all instances the toxic gases exceed a FED of 3.0 by just over 8~minutes. The Victim 4 location is far enough from the fire thermal hazards are not as significant however toxic gases are a hazard. Once the door gets opened at 5~minutes and 27~seconds in the two vent case, and 8~minutes and 17~seconds in the no vent case, the ambient air slows the increase of FED. No toxic gas values were available at victim 5 however the values were below the LC50 for thermal hazards.

\subsection{Effect of No Intervention}

THIS SECTION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.

% To evaluate the effect of no intervention three experiments were conducted where fire department intervnetion was delayed to analyze the effect not intervening has on potential trapped occupants. Experiments 1 was the delayed intervention experiment when no vetilation was provided. Experiment 12 was the delayed intervention where the ventilaiton configuration was one room of fire with one window vent. Experiment 17 was the delayed intervention experiment where the ventilation configuration was two rooms of fire, each with one window vent. Figures \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-No_Vent}, \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-Single_Vent} and \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-Two_Vent} show the no vent, single vent and two vent configuratoins respectivily.  

% \subsubsection{Pig Skin Temperatures}
% The surface and subsurface tempature of the pig skins can be utilized to quantify the impact of fire department intervention. Table \ref{tab:pig_skin_temp_increase} shows the average temperature recorded on the surface and subsurface of the pig skin in both the cases where a fire department intervention was preformed as compared to those where no intervention is preformed.

% \section{Water Vapor Measurement}
% Of the 26 experiments conducted water vapor was successfully measured during a portion of the 11 times. Three different scenarios provided complete water vapor concentration data and were successful for the entire duration of the experiment. The majority of the measurments were taken in Bedroom 4 at a height of 1~ft. Three measurments were taken on the bed next to victim location at a height of 3~ft.

\subsection{Prior to Intervention}


% Figures 1-3 show data from these three experiments (experiment numbering scheme was utilized to classify experiment type, not indicate order of experiment completion). In the single bedroom, unvented fire condition, Experiment 6 shows that even without water application, the fire environment itself can create large amounts of water vapor (almost 5\% by volume). While water application is associated with a relatively minor (~0.5\%) increase in water concentration, a significantly larger contribution to the moisture level at this location is attributed to the fire itself.



\section{Effect of Ventilation Configuration on Knock Back Capability}
In the following subsections, the temperatures measured within the fire room are used to determine the time to ``knock back'' the fire, which is defined as the period from initial water application to when all measured temperatures in the fire room are less than 400~$^\circ$F, the upper temperature limit of the `ordinary' thermal class for firefighter operating conditions proposed by Utech~\hl{[CITE]}. The ``knock back'' times are compared between experiments in five different groups based on fire attack method. Three of the groups contain experiments that used an interior fire attack method, and two of the sets contain experiments in which the first suppression event was an exterior fire attack. The differentiating factor between experiments within the three interior fire attack groups is the ventilation configuration, while the main difference between experiments within the two other groups is the ventilation configuration and the fire attack method used after the initial exterior suppression event.

\subsection{Flow \& Move with Solid Stream}
The `flow and move' method with a solid stream from a smooth bore nozzle was the primary fire attack method used during Experiments~2, 7, and 13, which contained the `No Vent', `Single Vent', and `Two Vent' ventilation configurations, respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_int_1} contains a plot of the Bedroom~1 temperatures over the duration from six seconds before the start of interior suppression to one minute after for each experiment.

\begin{figure}[H]

The `flow and move' method with a solid stream from a smooth bore nozzle was the primary attack method used during each experiment. The blue shaded areas represent water flow from the hose stream.} 
	\label{fig:knockback_int_1}
\end{figure}

The Bedroom~1 temperatures before the start of suppression for Experiment~2 are indicative of temperatures before flashover, while the Bedroom~1 temperatures at the same instance during Experiments~7 and 13 are indicative of a room that has transitioned to flashover. The fire room failed to reach flashover in Experiment~2 because the `No Vent' ventilation configuration significantly restricted the flow of oxygen to the fire room, unlike the `Single Vent' and `Two Vent' configurations in which oxygen was provided to the fire room through the open window of Bedroom~1.

Despite the difference in Bedroom~1 temperatures before suppression, the Bedroom~1 temperatures responded similarly to the suppression event in all three experiments: 30 seconds after the start of suppression, Bedroom~1 temperatures decreased to values below 400~$^\circ$F and eventually converged to values near 200~$^\circ$F by 50 seconds after the start of suppression. 

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Shutdown \& Move with Solid Stream}
The `shutdown and move' method with a solid stream from a smooth bore nozzle was the primary fire attack method used during Experiments~6, 8, and 14, which contained the `No Vent', `Single Vent', and `Two Vent' ventilation configurations, respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_int_2} contains a plot of the Bedroom~1 temperatures over the duration from six seconds before the start of interior suppression to one minute after for each experiment.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

The blue shaded areas represent water flow from the hose stream.}
	\label{fig:knockback_int_2}
\end{figure}

The distribution of Bedroom~1 temperatures before suppression in Experiment~6 was significantly larger than the distribution of Bedroom~1 temperatures at the same instance in Experiments~8 and 14. This difference can once again be attributed to the `No Vent' ventilation configuration that was used for Experiment~6, which significantly restricted the flow of oxygen to the fire room.

Despite the difference in Bedroom~1 temperatures before suppression, the Bedroom~1 temperatures responded similarly to the suppression event in all three experiments: the temperatures only began to significantly decrease during the third period of water flow (around 30 seconds after the start of suppression), when the attack crew was at the end of the hall near the Bedroom~1 doorway. For Experiment~6, all temperatures dropped below 400~$^\circ$F by the end of the third instance of water flow. 

It's possible that all Bedroom~1 temperatures in Experiment~8 behaved in a manner similar to Experiment~6. At the very least, the Bedroom~1 temperature 7~ft above the floor behaved in a manner similar to Experiment~6. However, the true response of the other three Bedroom~1 temperatures to the third period of water flow is unknown. Based on the sharp rise in the temperature 1~ft, 3~ft, and 5~ft above the floor during the third period of water flow and erratic behavior that exists in the temperature data from the same locations later in the experiment, it is likely the thermocouples fell and came in contact with burning material. 

Although the Bedroom~1 temperatures began to sharply decline during the third instance of water flow during Experiment~14, the temperatures didn't drop below 400~$^\circ$F until the fourth period of water flow around 45 seconds after the start of suppression. The longer duration of Bedroom~1 temperature decline might be due to the fact that the `Two Vent' setup used during Experiment~14 contained two fire rooms, so the attack crew divided water between the two rooms instead of using all the water to extinguish the fire in Bedroom~1.

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Flow \& Move with Narrow Fog}
The `flow and move' method with a narrow fog stream from a combination nozzle was the primary fire attack method used during Experiments~11 and 16, which contained the `Single Vent' and `Two Vent' ventilation configuration, respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_int_3} contains a plot of the Bedroom~1 temperatures over the duration from six seconds before the start of interior suppression to one minute after the event for each experiment.

\begin{figure}[H]

The blue shaded areas represent water flow from the hose stream.}
	\label{fig:knockback_int_3}
\end{figure}

In both experiments, all Bedroom~1 temperatures decreased to values around 200~$^\circ$F after the attack crew flowed water in a narrow fog stream for less than 30 seconds while moving down the hallway. The Bedroom~1 temperatures decreased at a slightly faster rate in Experiment~11, which can be attributed to the `Single Vent' configuration used during the experiment, which contained one fire room, while Experiment~16 used the `Two Vent' configuration, which contained two fire rooms.

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Initial Exterior Attack at Bedroom~1 Window}
Experiments~18, 20, 22, and 24 each had a similar initial suppression event that involved flowing water from the exterior of the structure into the fire room through the window of Bedroom~1. Water was applied in a solid stream pattern from a smooth bore nozzle during every experiment except Experiment~24, which used a combination nozzle set to a straight stream pattern to flow water. Experiments~18 and 20 contained the `Single Vent' ventilation configuration, and Experiments~22 and 24 contained the `Two Vent' ventilation configuration. Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_ext_1} contains a plot of the Bedroom~1 temperatures over the duration from four seconds before the start of the initial suppression to 24 seconds after for each experiment.

\begin{figure}[H]

The blue shaded areas represent water flow from the hose stream.}
	\label{fig:knockback_ext_1}
\end{figure}

After the initial suppression event, the Bedroom~1 temperatures significantly decreased at a similar rate in all four experiments. Additionally, the temperature distribution became inverted once the temperatures began to decline and remained inverted along the plotted duration. 

The value to which the temperatures decreased is dependent upon the experimental configuration. During Experiments~18 and 20, which used the `Single Vent' setup, the largest temperature recorded after the initial suppression event was below 400~$^\circ$F, while the largest temperature recorded after the initial suppression event was between 800~$^\circ$F and 900~$^\circ$F for Experiments~22 and 24, which used the `Two Vent' setup. The discrepancy in maximum temperature after the suppression event can be partially attributed to the fact that the fire in the `Two Vent' configuration was larger than the fire in the `Single Vent' configuration. 

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Exterior Attack at Bedroom~1 Window with Additional Attack}
Experiments~22 and 24 each had a similar initial suppression event that involved flowing water from the exterior of the structure into the fire room through the window of Bedroom~1 using a solid stream from a smooth bore nozzle and a straight stream from a combination nozzle, respectively. Both experiments contained the `Two Vent' ventilation configuration. However, the interventions performed after the initial suppression event differ between the two experiments. 

After the initial exterior attack in Experiment~22, the attack crew performed an interior attack that resembled the `shutdown and move' attack method. After the initial exterior attack in Experiment~24, the attack crew moved to the window of Bedroom~2 and performed a second exterior attack by flowing water into the second fire room through the window of Bedroom~2. The temperatures measured by four different thermocouple arrays over the duration from six seconds before the start of the initial exterior suppression event to 95 seconds after were plotted for each experiment. Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_ext_2} contains a plot of the Bedroom~1 temperatures and a plot of the Bedroom~2 temperatures for each experiment. A plot of the temperatures at the end of the hallway and a plot of the temperatures in Bedroom~4 (bedroom with open door) for each experiment are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_ext_3}.

	\label{fig:knockback_ext_2}
\end{figure}

Based on the plots of the temperatures within the two fire rooms, the initial exterior attack during each experiment had a very similar effect on the fire environments in Bedroom~1 and Bedroom~2. As a result of the initial attack, the Bedroom~1 temperatures significantly decreased and became inverted. The Bedroom~1 temperatures in each experiment decreased according to the following: the temperature at 7~ft above the floor decreased to a value around 200~$^\circ$F; the temperature at 5~ft decreased to a value between 400~$^\circ$F and 500~$^\circ$F; the temperature at 3~ft decreased to a value between 600~$^\circ$F and 700~$^\circ$F; and the temperature at 1~ft decreased to a value between 800~$^\circ$F and 900~$^\circ$F. Furthermore, despite the differences in attack methods after the exterior suppression at the Bedroom~1 window, the Bedroom~1 temperatures continued to decrease in a similar manner over the plotted duration for both experiments, suggesting the initial attack extinguished most of the fire in Bedroom~1.

The initial exterior attack at the Bedroom~1 window caused the Bedroom~2 temperatures to slightly decrease in both experiments. However, the decrease was only temporary; during the time period between the end of the initial exterior attack and the next intervention, the temperatures increased and nearly returned to their original values in each of the experiments. An additional slight decrease in Bedroom~2 temperatures occurred during Experiment~22 after hall suppression began. Then, as the attack crew moved down the hall closer to Bedroom~2, the temperatures started to significantly decrease as the crew flowed water. While the Bedroom~2 temperatures decreased at a significant rate in response to the interior attack during Experiment~22, the Bedroom~2 temperatures decreased at a faster rate during the exterior attack performed at the window of Bedroom~2 during Experiment~24.

\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier 

The plots in Figure~\ref{fig:knockback_ext_3} show that the temperatures at the end of the hall along with the temperatures in Bedroom~4 behaved similarly in Experiments~22 and 24. The temperatures at the end of the hall initially decreased in response to the first exterior suppression event. Following the end of water flow from the initial event, the temperatures measured at 5~ft and 7~ft above the floor at the end of the hall began to increase. In fact, the temperature 7~ft above the floor nearly returned to its original value before the next intervention in each experiment. The hall temperatures decreased significantly in response to the second suppression event performed in each experiment. However, they declined at a faster rate in response to the hall suppression event during the interior attack in Experiment~22. Additionally, after the second exterior attack in Experiment~24, the hall temperatures at 7~ft and 5~ft began to increase and approach their values before suppression. The hallway temperatures decreased permanently only after an interior attack was initiated following the two exterior attacks. The Bedroom~4 temperatures had a nearly identical response to the first suppression intervention during Experiments~22 and 24: they began to steadily decline following the event and continued to decline at a similar rate as the remaining experimental interventions were performed.

\section{Ability to Influence the Flow of Products of Combustion}
This test series included specific instrumentation to evaluate the ability of hose streams to move products of combustion in residential structure fires. Instrumentation was installed at the window when exhaust was provided, at the door to the fire room, and at the start of the hallways to evaluate the flows during the different suppression tactics.

\subsection{Interior}
During the interior suppression tactics, the velocity probes at the start of the hallway and the window to the fire room, show that flowing water down the hallway has the ability to stop the flow of smoke out of the hallway while additionally impacting the flow in venting bedroom window. Figure~\ref{fig:push_fire_interior_flow_move} shows the flows at the start of the front door, start of the hallway, and bedroom window for the single room of fire and single open window ventilation cases where the flow and move tactic was utilized.

\label{fig:push_fire_interior_flow_move}
\end{figure}

In all three experiments when the attack crew made their approach down the hallway flowing water, the velocity of gases at the front door changed. While the line was flowing the velocity of the fresh air flowing in the bottom of the door increased. The velocity of products of combustion exiting the top of the door decreased, almost to no flow at all. As the crew made it further down the hall, the velocity of inflow decreased and the flow out the top of the door resumed. 

At the start of the hall, the initial flow of water decreased the velocity the products of combustion were exiting out the top of the door from 5~m/s to almost zero. The inflow in the hall also decreased, indicating the exchange of gases from the entrance to the hallway and the living room almost zero. 

At the bedroom window vent the initial water application down the hall decreases the velocity of the gases exiting the window initially until the crew makes it to the fire room, at which time it increases the velocity exiting the window. Once the water from the hose stream hit the velocity probes the readings became inaccurate. 

Figure \ref{fig:push_fire_interior_shut_move} shows the flows at the front door, start of the hallway, and bedroom window for the single room of fire and single open window ventilation cases where the shutdown and move tactic was utilized.

\label{fig:push_fire_interior_shut_move}
\end{figure}

At the front door, on the initial flow, the velocity at the front door became all inflow, or a uni-directional vent, flowing into the structure. Once the line is shut down to move forward, the door vent became bi-directional again with gases flowing in at the bottom and out at the top. This was noted at all points the line was opened. 

Similarly at the start of the hall, the each time the line was opened the gas velocities became uni-directional down the hallway towards the fire room. Once the line was shutdown, the flow resumed with inflow at the bottom and outflow at the top.

The flow out the bedroom window increased the first time the line was open, but subsequent water applications did not produce the same changes. Once the line reached the fire room, the water stream hit the velocity probes, resulting in inaccurate readings. 

During interior suppression it is apparent water application has the potential to impact the flow of products of combustion. Applying water down the hallway, changed the velocity to be all in the direction of water application. Once the line is shutdown the flow returns to the conditions prior to application. If the fire is knocked down (temperatures reduced), the magnitude of the velocity changes, however the direction remains the same. The flow and move case was not as effective at maintaining the directional change of gas flow, potentially due to the difficulty in maintaining the nozzle pattern while moving down the hallway. The shutdown and move case changed the velocity each time the nozzle was opened, potentially because the attack crew was able to maintain a better application pattern in a fixed position.

\subsection{Exterior}
During the exterior suppression tactics, the velocity probes at the fire room window, the velocity probes at the start of the hallway, and when open the velocity probes at the front door, show the impact of exterior water application on the flow of productions of combustion. 

Figure \ref{fig:push_fire_exterior} shows the flows at the front door, start of the hallway, and bedroom window for the single room of fire and single open window ventilation cases where exterior. For the top row and middle row, experiments 18 and 20 respectively, the front door was closed until after the water was applied through the window. The bottom row, experiment 21 had the front door open at the time of the application.

\end{figure}

The front door being closed for the first two experiments, 18 and 20 yields no change to the flow at the door from water application. In the third experiment, 21, the front door was open when water was applied. The flow at the top middle probe went from approximately 0 to an inflow of 1.5~m/s. This indicates more air being drawn in when water flow occurred in the window. Following the water flow the probes were moved to allow for the attack crew to enter which is the return to 0 for several seconds. When the probes were put back in place the gas velocities were of the same magnitude as they were before they were moved. 

At the start of the hallway the application of water decreased the velocity of the gases at the top of the hallway from 5~m/s to 2.5~m/s indicating less products of combustion were flowing towards the door immediately following water application.

At the window the water was applied from, the flow of gases when from a bi-directional vent with inflow only on the bottom probe and outflow on the upper four probes to complete inflow. This was due both to the cooling of the gases causing contraction and the air entrainment in the stream entering the window. 

When the end of the hallway values are evaluated with the window values it becomes apparent that entrainment is not the predominant reason for inflow in the window. The lack of increased flow at the start of the hallway even when the front door is open creating a flow path, indicates the predominant mechanism of flow change was due to the cooling gasses contracting. This is only applicable when a straight stream or solid stream are used. 

Figure \ref{fig:push_fire_dead_end_fog} shows the change in velocity at the bedroom 1 doorway and the start of the hallway when a fog stream is used on the exterior window.  The fog stream in the window is capable of pushing products of combustion into the hallway, however further down the hallway at the start of the hall, the fog suppression has an opposite effect, where it stops the flow into the living room.

\label{fig:push_fire_dead_end_fog}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:push_fire_SS_BR2} shows the change in velocity at the bedroom 2 doorway (across from the fire room) and the start of the hallway when a straight stream is used on the fire room window. Immediately following water application the products flowing into bedroom 2 decrease (negative flow is into room). Additionally the flow at the start of the hall decreases as well. This is most likely due to the suppression of the fire.

\label{fig:push_fire_SS_BR2}
\end{figure}

The application of water from the exterior has the potential to alter the flow of the products of combustion. When a solid stream or straight stream are utilized, the flow from the fire room to the remainder of the structure is minimal.  

\section{Impact of ``Whip'' on Regrowth}
During all experiments that used an exterior fire attack method, an interior attack was performed after the exterior suppression event(s) to completely extinguish the fire. In nearly every one of these experiments, the temperature measured 7~ft above the floor in the fire room began to increase in the time between the end of exterior suppression and start of interior suppression, indicating the exterior attack hadn't fully extinguished the fire and that it was beginning to regrow. The fire ``regrowth intensity'' during this period was quantified for each applicable experiment as the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature 7~ft above the floor in the fire room during the period divided by the total duration of the period.

The order of suppression events performed during Experiments~18 and 20 was an exterior attack through the window of Bedroom~1 followed by an interior attack to completely extinguish the fire. Both experiments contained the `Single Vent' configuration and used a smooth bore nozzle to flow water. The main difference between Experiments~18 and 20 was that towards the end of the initial suppression event during Experiment~20, the nozzle was advanced forward through the window opening, and water was applied in a ``whip'' pattern with the nozzle's bale half closed. During Experiment~18, however, the nozzle was aimed at the ceiling of Bedroom~1 for the entire exterior attack. Comparing the fire regrowth intensity during the two experiments, the rate of temperature increase during the fire regrowth period for Experiment~20 was 1.0~$^\circ$F/sec less than the rate of temperature increase during the regrowth period for Experiment~18.

Experiment~24 used the `Two Vent' configuration, which contained two fire rooms: Bedroom~1 and Bedroom~2. The initial suppression event performed during Experiment~24 was an exterior attack through the window of Bedroom~1, followed by an exterior attack through the window of Bedroom~2 and a final interior attack to fully extinguish the fire. A combination nozzle was used to flow water in a straight stream pattern. Towards the end of each exterior suppression event, the nozzle was advanced forward through the window opening, and water was applied as a narrow fog in a ``whip'' pattern. Two fire regrowth intensities were calculated for Experiment~24---one for each fire room. The initial suppression event performed during Experiment~27 was an exterior attack through the window of Bedroom~4, the fire room, followed by an interior attack to completely extinguish the fire. A combination nozzle was used to flow water in a straight stream pattern during Experiment~27, and the exterior attack did not include water application in the ``whip'' pattern towards the end of the suppression event. Looking at Table~\ref{table:regrowth_intensity}, the fire regrowth intensity for each fire room in Experiment~24 was much less than the regrowth intensity from Experiment~27.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Fire Regrowth Intensity during Experiments~18, 20, 24, and 27}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} 
\hline
\multirow{3}{*}{Experiment} & \multirow{3}{*}{Fire Room} 	& Regrowth Period & Regrowth  \\ 
							& 								& Duration 		  & Intensity \\
							& 								& (sec) 		  & ($^\circ$F/sec) \\							
\hline \hline
18 							& Bedroom~1 					& 32 			  & 5.3 	\\ \hline
20 							& Bedroom~1 					& 89 			  & 4.3 	\\ \hline
24 							& Bedroom~1 					& 88 			  & 2.2 	\\ \hline
24 							& Bedroom~2 					& 69 			  & 0.4 	\\ \hline
27 							& Bedroom~4 					& 23 			  & 22.4 	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:regrowth_intensity}
\end{table}

Overall, the temperature rise during the time between the end of the exterior attack and start of interior suppression occurred at a slower rate and was less drastic for experiments that included a nozzle ``whip'' towards the end of exterior suppression compared to experiments that did not involve a ``whip'' at the end of exterior suppression. Using the ``whip'' pattern allowed water to reach a larger surface area of the fuel compared to flowing water exclusively with the nozzle aimed at the ceiling of the fire room.

\section{Impact of Door Control}
Controlling the access door was a tactical consideration from the DHS-2010 `Study of the Effectiveness of Fire Service Vertical Ventilation and Suppression Tactics in Single Family Homes.' When gaining access the open front door provided oxygen to the ventilation limited fire, causing the fire to grow and spread. \cite{DHS2010} To access the impact door control had a on a bedroom fire with a long hallway four experiments were conducted. Two with the bedroom window closed (No Vent) and two with the bedroom window open (Single Vent). In each case the start of the hallway to determine if additional flow was moving towards the fire room prior to suppression activities commencing. 

\subsection{No Vent}
To evaluate the impact of door control experiment 3 which included door control is compared to experiment 6, where no door control was provided. Figure \ref{fig:door_control_no_vent} below shows the gas velocity at the start of the hallway. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Door_Control/Experiment_6/Start_Hall_Flow}

\caption[Door Control Effectiveness - No Ventilation]{Start of Hall Flow with no door control Experiment 6 (left), with door control Experiment 3 (right) for interior attack.The blue shaded areas represent where water was flowing from the hose stream. Charts start 15 seconds prior to the tactic is started and continue until 90 seconds after the door was opened.}
\label{fig:door_control_no_vent}
\end{figure}

The use of door control no limited impact on the effectiveness of the tactic when no additional openings were provided and the hose stream was used to seal the hallway preventing the abmient air from reaching the fire room. and provided.

\subsection{Single Window Vent}
To evaluate the impact door control had on two rooms of fire with ventilation opposite the attack crew experiment 14 was conducted without door control and experiment 15 included door control. Figure \ref{fig:door_control_vent} shows the velocity at the start of the hallway during the two experiments.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Door_Control/Experiment_14/Start_Hall_Flow}

\caption[Door Control Effectiveness - Window Vent]{Start of Hall Flow with no door control Experiment 14 (left), with door control Experiment 15 (right) for interior attack with the window venting prior to initiating the tactic. The blue shaded areas represent where water was flowing from the hose stream. Charts start 15 seconds prior to the tactic is started and continue until 90 seconds after the door was opened.}
\label{fig:door_control_vent}
\end{figure}

When two rooms of fire were opposite the attack team, the use of door control had more effect on the flow. The velocity of air being drawing towards the fire (the bottom four velocity measurements) in experiment 14 were significantly more than in experiment 15. Once the line was opened down the hallway it sealed the hallway much like the no vent opposite case, and negated the flow. This illustrates how Door control is a potential viable tactic to limit the air drawn towards the fire until the attack team can being flowing water from a position between the entry door at the fire.   

\section{Flowing While Moving vs. Shutting Down to Move}
There were two methods of approach to the fire. The first titled `flow and move' involved flowing the hose line while moving down the hallway towards the fire room. The second titled `shutdown and move' involved flowing the nozzle from a fixed position, shutting it down, moving up to the next position, flowing again, shutting it down and moving to the next position until the crew reached the fire room. This section will compare these two tactics as they relate to temperatures in the approach path, temperatures in the fire room, and gas velocities in the hallway for the three ventilation cases tested. 

\subsection{Approach Temperatures}

The single room fires with no ventilation as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Vent_Profile-No_Vent} were interior attacks with no ventilation opposite. Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent} shows the comparison between the flow and move tactic and shutdown and move tactic. With no ventilation provided opposite the attack crew, the shutdown and move tactic results in temperatures rebounding in the upper level of the hallway when the line is shutdown as the attack crew makes their way down the hallway. This is not seen in the flow and move tactic as the hose stream is continuously cooling as the crew makes their way down the hallway. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Flow_vs_Shutdown/Experiment_2/End_Hall}

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent}
\end{figure}

Ventilation, provided opposite the attack crew, has little impact on the flow and move vs. shutdown and move tactics as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_Vent}for the single room fire and Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Two_Vent} for the two rooms of fire. The same temperature rebounding occurs in the shutdown and move case, it is again not seen in the flow and move case.

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Two_Vent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fire Room Temperatures}
The ultimate goal of any method of fire attack is to extinguish the fire in the fire compartment. When comparing the flow and move tactic and shutdown and move tactics it is important to note the effect on the fire room during approach. Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent_Fire_Temp} shows the two tactics and their effect on the fire room temperatures. In the flow and move case, initially the water has no impact on the fire compartment as it is not physically possible for water to enter the compartment from the position the crew began to flow water. As the crew advanced down the hallway, water begins to enter the compartment and effect the fire. It is not until the crew reaches the compartment that greatest impact occurs. For the shutdown and move case it is more pronounced as neither the first nor second position in the hall resulted in temperature reduction in the fire room. It was not until the crew was at the end of the hall flowing into the fire room that the water had an impact on temperatures. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Flow_vs_Shutdown/Experiment_2/Bedroom_1_Temperature}

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent_Fire_Temp}
\end{figure}

Providing a vent opposite the attack crew does as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_Vent_Fire_Temp} does not change the effect of the tactics on the fire room. The water being directed down the hall in both the flow and move and shutdown and move cases cannot impact the fire room from the entrance to the hallway. It is not until the crew makes it to the midpoint of the hallway that water can enter the room and begin to have an effect. It isn't until the crew reaches the fire room and is able to direct the stream into the compartment that the temperatures drop significantly.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Flow_vs_Shutdown/Experiment_9/Bedroom_1_Temperature}

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_Vent_Fire_Temp}
\end{figure}

With an additional room of fire in the two rooms of fire with two window vents opposite as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Two_Vent_Fire_Temp} the additional energy being released from the fire results in more difficulty in cooling the fire compartment.  

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Two_Vent_Fire_Temp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gas Velocity}
Examining the air movement at the start of the hallway for the two cases illustrates the ability of the hose stream to move products of combustion away from the nozzle crew and draw air in behind them as the make their way down the hallway. For the case with no ventilation opposite the advancing attack crew, Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent_Velocity} shows that the gas velocity at the top of the hallway goes from approximately 5~m/s out toward the front door to roughly 0~m/s on the initial flow, and the values of the lower gas velocity probes go from flowing down the hallway toward the fire to 0~m/s as well stopping flow. 

As the crew advances down the hallway in the flow and move tactic, all velocities maintain a flow near 0~m/s until the nozzle is shut down where. The flow at the top of the opening returns to about 1~m/s as the products of combustion seek the low pressure at the front door.  With the shutdown and move case, as the crew shutdown the nozzle to move the gas velocities return in between flows to values of about 2.5~m/s or half the initial velocity. Once the crew reaches the fire room and conducts the last flow, the gas velocity at the top of the door returns to 1~m/s as the combustion products seek the low pressure much like the flow and move case.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Flow_vs_Shutdown/Experiment_2/Start_Hall_Flow}

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent_Velocity}
\end{figure}

Providing ventilation ahead of the nozzle crew changes the ability of the hose stream to move the products of combustion as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_Vent_Velocity}. The initial water flow now changes the velocity across the entire hallway entrance to be down the hallway towards the fire room. This occurs for the flow and move tactic and the shutdown and move tactic. When the crew uses the flow and move tactic to advance, the velocity trends toward to zero as they advance. The velocity at the top of the hallways stays near zero until the crew makes it approximately half way down the hall where it returns to 1~m/s. With the shutdown and move case as soon as the line shutdown the flow resumes towards the low pressure at the front door. When the nozzle is opened half way down the hallway the flow goes unidirectionally down the hallway towards the fire again until the nozzle shuts down. This happens at all points of flow with the shutdown and move case.

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_Vent_Velocity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{No Water Application Down Hallway}
Traditionally firefighters have been taught that there are negative consequences to applying water prior to reaching the fire compartment. \hl{NEED CITATION} This, combined with training fires which did not cause hazardous thermal sceneries lead to firefighters believing that water application down a hall, prior to advancing is not necessary. The structural turnout gear will provide enough protection to make it to the compartment before applying water. To evaluate this instrumentation was placed outside the fire compartment and at various places down the hallway.

Uteh developed three thermal classes for environments found inside the structure. These classes combined temperature (convective) and heat flux (radiative) to develop zones quantifying the hazard thermal energy poses to firefighters in structural gear. The routine zone was those areas were structural turnout gear was not necessary for thermal protection. The ordinary zone was intended to be a thermal classification where a firefighter in full protective equipment could remain for the duration of their air supply. The emergency zone identified a zone for which a fully encapsulated firefighter could only remain in for under a minute, on the upper range only a few seconds.  

Figure \ref{fig:Thermal_Classes_Approach_Delayed_Suppression} shows the thermal exposure (temperature vs. heat flux) for the three experiments where suppression was delayed to evaluate the conditions had suppression not occurred, plotted against three thermal zones defined by Utech. Each point represents an average heat flux and temperature for which the a suppression crew would have been exposed while in each of the five positions. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Thermal_Class/Experiment_1_Thermal_Exposure}

The lightly shaded areas represent areas outside of Utech's thermal classes but still a relatively similar thermal hazard.}
\label{fig:Thermal_Classes_Approach_Delayed_Suppression}
\end{figure}

The end of the hallway falls in the emergency range class at 5~ft and 3~ft for each of the three experiments, indicating a firefighter would have less than 1 minute to suppress the fire once they reached the end of the hallway before receiving a burn injury. In the no ventilation case (Experiment 1) and the two rooms of fire with two vent case (Experiment 14) the 1~ft exposure was within the ordinary range, however may have still resulted in an injury. Although a more experienced firefighter may be able to achieve this, any occurrence which either delayed or prevented suppression would have resulted in a burn injury. Additionally the emergency zone is an exposure that would most likely damage the firefighters protective equipment, even if injury did not occur. 

\section{Impact of Water Usage}
The amount of water used during each suppression tactic was measured from the start of the experiment until the fire was extinguished. Some hot spots remained, however no visible flame or smoldering existed. Figure \ref{fig:water_flow_all} illustrates the water used in all experiments. The average water used varied from as little as 30.6 gallons in a single room exterior attack to as much as 257.2 gallons in a two room interior attack.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Water_Flow/Water_Flow}
\caption[Water Flow All Experiments]{Water flow during all experiments grouped by ventilation type and attack method.}
\label{fig:water_flow_all}
\end{figure}

In the single room interior attacks the water usage did not vary with additional ventilation. The majority of the water was utilized in cooling the environment as the attack crew approached the fire from the living room area, thus regardless of if the window was open or closed a similar amount of water was used. When a second room was involved in fire the amount of water used more than doubled. The charts in Figure \ref{fig:water_flow_vent_compare} break up the water used by ventilation configuration and attack method.  

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:water_flow_vent_compare}
\end{figure}

The interior suppression tactics utilized some water for cooling the approach to the fire. To provide a direct comparison Figure \ref{fig:Door_vs_window} shows the comparison of the amount of water used on a single room fire from both the window and the door. The door values are adjusted to remove the water used for the cooling during the approach which did not contribute to suppression. For the doorway, the total flow was calculated from the point the crew was capable of directing water into the fire room until the completion of the experiment. For the window, the crew did not utilize water while approaching the fire thus all water usage was accounted for. In order to provide an accurate comparison only single room fires with a open window were utilized. Additionally the point where water was capable of entering the room during a flow and move approach was not possible thus only shutdown and move approaches were utilized.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption[Water Usage For Single Room]{Water usage comparison for a single room fire where the door way suppression is adjusted to account for cooling during the approach not contributing to suppression.}
\label{fig:Door_vs_window}
\end{figure}

As expected, adjusting the interior tactic water usage as described above results in an average usage of 51.7 gallons for the window and 59.6 gallons in the doorway. When taking into account the accuracy of the measurement device theses two values can be considered the same.  

\section{Large Volume Gas Cooling}
In order to analyze the effect of gas cooling in a large space under challenging conditions the interior walls of the structure were removed with the exception of the master bedroom wall separating the master bedroom from the rest of the structure. The open floor plan allowed for the analysis of gas cooling as a result of indirect attack, when the fire can not be accessed with the hose stream without crawling into the structure through the flow path. Four different application methods `Pulse', `Long Pulse', `Sweeping Pulse' and `Narrow Fog Sweep' were utilized at two different flow rates, 95~gpm and 150~gpm. Table \ref{tab:Gas_Cooling_Techniques} lists the application techniques, flow rate, and average flow for each of the methods and flows used. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Gas Cooling Application Techniques}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Technique & Flow Rate (gpm) & Average Flow (Gallons)\\ \hline
Pulse & 95 & 0.87 \\ \hline
Long Pulse & 95 & 1.68 \\ \hline
Sweeping Pulse & 95 & 5.83 \\ \hline
Narrow Fog Sweep & 95 & 6.98 \\ \hline
Pulse & 150 & 0.52 \\ \hline
Long Pulse & 150 & 2.95 \\ \hline
Sweeping Pulse & 150 & 9.73 \\ \hline
Narrow Fog Sweep & 150 & 8.16 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:Gas_Cooling_Techniques}
\end{table}

\subsection{Pulse}
The most common technique used for gas cooling while approaching a fire is the short pulse. The combination nozzle is set to a wide fog pattern and the nozzle is open and closed rapidly, remaining open for less than 1~second. Figure \ref{fig:gas_pulse_95} shows the effect of the gas temperatures in the area of the attack team when a utilizing a pulse techniques with a 95~gpm nozzle. With less than a gallon of water, even in a wide fog pattern has little to no effect on temperature near the approach crew. The fire compartment is also un-effected. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Pulse_95gpm/1TC}

\label{fig:gas_pulse_95}
\end{figure}

Increasing the flow rate of the nozzle has does not change the impact of the tactic as the water flow is still less than 1~gallon. Figure \ref{fig:gas_pulse_150} shows the temperatures both near the attack crew and in the fire compartment remain unchanged. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:gas_pulse_150}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Long Pulse}
Increasing the length of the pulse to increase the total flow by a factor of two had a slight effect on the effectiveness of the cooling. Figure \ref{fig:gas_long_pulse_95} shows the effect of the gas temperatures in the area of the attack team when a utilizing a long pulse techniques with a 95~gpm nozzle. Increasing the duration of the pulse and the total flow to 1.68~gallons is capable of decreasing the temperature however by less than 100~$^\circ$F. The temperature rebounds within 15~seconds of the decrease back to the level prior to application. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Long_Pulse_95gpm/1TC}

\label{fig:gas_long_pulse_95}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:gas_long_pulse_150} increasing the flow rate to 150~gpm increases the cooling effectiveness however the temperatures rebound within 15~seconds of application.

\label{fig:gas_long_pulse_150}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Sweeping Pulse}
To increase the volume of water and the application location a longer pulse, moved horizontal from right to left in the space in a sweeping motion was used. Figure \ref{fig:gas_sweep_pulse_95} shows the impact of the sweeping pulse on the temperatures in fire compartment and the area around the attack crew. The sweeping pulse has a more significant impact on the temperatures with temperatures in the fire compartment reacting due to the mixing and more significant cooling in the area of the attack crew. Although the cooling is more significant than the pulse and long pulse the temperatures still return to the state they were prior to water application within 15~seconds.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Sweep_Pulse_95gpm/1TC}

\label{fig:gas_sweep_pulse_95}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:gas_sweep_pulse_150} increasing the flow rate to 150~gpm increases further increases the cooling however the temperatures rebound within 15~seconds.

\label{fig:gas_sweep_pulse_150}
\end{figure}


\subsection {Narrow Fog Sweep}
Adjusting the pattern to a narrow fog from the wide fog pattern will increase the reach of the stream. Figure \ref{fig:gas_narrow_fog_95} shows the impact of the narrow fog sweep on the temperatures in fire compartment and the area around the attack crew. Increasing the reach of the stream over the pulse, long pulse and sweeping pulse has even more impact on the temperature reduction and temperatures take longer to rebound, approximately 20~seconds after application.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Narrow_Fog_Sweep_95gpm/1TC}
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Narrow_Fog_Sweep_95gpm/2TC}

\label{fig:gas_narrow_fog_95}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:gas_narrow_fog_150} increasing the flow rate to 150~gpm significantly increases the cooling and it increases the time to it takes the temperature to rebound from 20~seconds to 30~seconds. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:gas_narrow_fog_150}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Straight Stream}
To compare the cooling tactics to the approach tactics used in the hallway suppression experiments the same `Wall, Ceiling, Wall' technique was used, directed as much as possible towards the fire compartment with the 150~gpm setting. Figure  \ref{fig:gas_wall_ceiling_wall_150} shows the impact of the narrow fog sweep on the temperatures in fire compartment and the area around the attack crew. The wall ceiling wall technique has the most effect on gas temperatures in the area it was applied. It also has a slight effect on temperatures in the fire compartment. It also increases the time it takes the temperatures to rebound over the other gas cooling techniques to approximately 50~seconds.

\chapter{Tactical Considerations}

\section{Interior Attack is a Viable Option.}
When arriving on a residential structure fire where there is smoke showing, detemining the location and extent of the fire is in important part of the initial sizeup and often step one to developing an initial action plan. When the fire is not venting out an opening determining the location can be difficult. In this instance an interior attack may be the most effective way to locate, confine and suppress the fire. Figure \ref{fig:interior_attack_TC_smoke_showing} below shows an example of how difficult determining the exact location of the fire may be. Although the side `B/C' window shows dark black smoke, the fire is actually located in the `A/B' corner bedroom. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Tactical_Considerations/Interior_Attack/SIDE_A.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Tactical_Considerations/Interior_Attack/SIDE_C.jpg}
\caption[Smoke Showing - No Fire Showing]{Example of no fire showing with no open vents on a residential structure. Side A (left) has a front door and A/B corner window with smoke showing. Side C (right) shows darker smoke showing from the B/C corner. The fire is located in Bedroom 1 in the A/B corner of the structure.}
\label{fig:interior_attack_TC_smoke_showing}
\end{figure}

Commiting a suppression crew to the front door with a handline to locate an suppress the fire may be the most effective way to control the ventilation while searching for and extinguishing the fire. If this tactic is choosen futher considerations should be door control as identified by Kerber in 2013 \cite{UL_VerticalVent}, flowing while moving versus shutting down to move (Section \ref{tc:flow_vs_shutdown}, using your stream to cool as you approach the fire (Section \ref{tc:cool_as_you_advance}) and what effect that stream has on the flowpaths within the structure (Section \ref{tc:water_impact_flowpath}).

\section{There Can Be Survivable Spaces on Arrival at a Single Family Residential Home.}
When occupants become trapped in a structure fire, the number one priority for the arriving fire crews is rescue. A emphasis is often placed on the risk profile of a given scenario. The larger the benefit, the larger the risk which can be considered. Understanding the potential for a victim to survive a given environment is important to determining the potential benefit. If a victim can survive the environment, risking crews on a interior search prior to fire control is of greater benefit than if no survivable spaces. 

To things impact the survivability of a given space in the structure, the proximity to the fire and the elevation in the space. The proximity to the fire compartment relates to the thermal exposure where the elevation in the space relates to the exposure to toxic gases and thermal exposure. 

An occupant inside the compartment of origin would not have survived to the point of fire department intervention in any of the experiments. All of the experiments had the potential for flashover prior to fire department intervention. Occupants just outside the compartment of origin (hallway of the bedroom fire) were exposed to levels which exceeded the survivability threshold base on thermal exposure. Figure \ref{fig:FED_heat_TC} illustrates the thermal exposure calculated in the form of fractional effective dose where a value of 1.0 represents a fatal does. Victim 1, which was closest to the fire received the highest does where victim 5 was furtherest from the origin and received the lowest dose.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/FED/FED_Avg_Temp_FLux/No_Vent}

The shaded areas represent the various +/- one standard deviation for the average value recorded.}
\label{fig:FED_heat_TC}
\end{figure}

When the toxic gas exposure is concerned, the elevation in the space is the larger component. Victim 3 was located on the bed in the bedroom down the hall from the fire room, yet because of the elevation in all three ventilation cases received the largest dose. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/FED/FED_Avg_Gas/No_Vent}
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/FED/FED_Avg_Gas/Single_Vent}

\caption[Toxic Gas Exposure - Three Ventilation Configurations]{Fractional effective dose of toxic gas exposure based on CO, CO$_2$ and O$_2$. Left is the no ventilation case, center is the single vent with a single room of fire case and right is the two rooms of fire with two vent case. The shaded areas represent the various +/- one standard deviation for the average value recorded.}
\label{fig:FED_gas_TC}
\end{figure}

When developing a risk profile for a given scenario identifying the survivable spaces is important. Areas furthers from the compartment of origin and low in the space have the best chance of survival. Areas closest to the fire and high in the space have the least chance of survival. 

\section{Fire Doesn't Care What Direction Water Comes From.}
Effective application of water, weather from the interior doorway or from the exterior window into the fire compartment has a positive impact. The heat release rate of the fire is reduced, temperatures both near and remote from the fire are reduced and the rate at which toxic gases are produced slows making tactical ventilation effective. The tactical choice on where to apply water from should be based more on the time it takes to complete the tactic and less on the position the water is being applied from.

To have an impact on the fire, water must be applied to the compartment of origin. Figure \ref{fig:water_app_dir_TC_temp_reduce} shows the fire room temperature for an interior attack where the hose crew needs to apply water down the hallway and move down the hallway before water enters the compartment and reduces temperatures to a point where a firefighter could occupy the compartment in full protective gear (400$^\circ$F), and an exterior attack where water can be applied directly into the compartment from the exterior. Each is effective at reducing temperatures, the hallway attack takes slightly longer (30~seconds vs. 15~seconds) to reduce temperatures. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Knock_Back/Flow_and_Move_Solid_Stream/Experiment_7_Bedroom_1_Temps}
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Knock_Back/Ext_BR1_Window_Initial_Hit/Experiment_18_Bedroom_1_Temps}
\caption[Window vs. Hallway Water Application - Single Room Fire, Window Vent]{Fire room temperatures Experiment 7 - Interior (left), Experiments 18 - Exterior (right). The blue shaded areas represent water flow from the hose stream.}
\label{fig:water_app_dir_TC_temp_reduce}
\end{figure}

The most effective initial application method from outside the compartment, to coat the most surfaces (ceiling, walls, floor) in the room, was found to be a solid stream or straight stream at steep angle off the ceiling \cite{Weinchenk_watermapping}. When applying water from the exterior through a window, the straight or solid stream, without rapid movement was shown to have the least air entrainment \cite{Weinchenk_airentrainment} and thus least impact on the existing flow paths within the structure. When applying this to a window or door on the fireground this would be a straight stream or solid stream, directed from as close as possible directed at as steep an angle as possible. In some instances there will be obstructions to steep angle application such as landscaping or potential building outcroppings, this will not negate the effectiveness, only reduce the amount of surfaces coated. As the angle of application becomes shallower, the effectiveness of coating surfaces decreases. If the stream is no longer having a visual effect on the fire, repositioning the line or directing the stream off the top of the window frame are options to increase effectiveness. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Tactical_Considerations/Water_App_Direction/Exterior_Application.jpg}
\caption[Application Tactic - Exterior Attack]{Exterior water application using a steep angle off the ceiling.}
\label{fig:water_app_dir_TC_app_method}
\end{figure}

When choosing an interior attack, advancing to the seat of the fire without applying water, even in full protective gear, significantly increases the potential for injury. Using the reach of the stream while advancing to cool the environment around and ahead of your position only has a positive impact on the environment for both firefighters and potential occupants. Applying water while moving, moving the nozzle in a pattern had the most positive effect on the area around and ahead of the advancing hose crew. Once at the door to the compartment, where a lack of visibility limits the ability to determine the exact location of flames, a steep angle off the ceiling using a solid or straight stream will coat the most surfaces (wall, ceiling, floor) and provide the best protection prior to entering the compartment. 


\section{If you get water to where it needs to go, you don't need much.}
When dealing with a room and contents fire, the energy release rate is limited by the available oxygen (ventilation - limited) \cite{DHS2008}, \cite{DHS2010}. It does not take a large amount of water to absorb the energy being released and knock back the fire. Although less is not necessarily better, when a water supply has not been established, or in areas where no municipal supply exists, water application should not be delayed to establish a water supply. Even a 500gallon supply tank can be sufficient to knock back two rooms of fire.    

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Water_Flow/Water_Flow}
\caption[Water Flow All Experiments]{Water flow during all experiments grouped by ventilation type and attack method.}
\label{fig:water_amount_TC_all}
\end{figure}

During the 25 suppression experiments conducted, the most water utilized for initial knock-back and suppression was less than 250~gallons. When attacking a single room and contents fire, in a residential structure, knock back and initial suppression is often possible less than 100~gallons, in some instances less than 75~gallons. Even flowing while moving to the compartment of origin did not result in utilizing more water than available in a 300~gallon supply tank.  

\hl {NEED TO ADD SOMETHING TO KEEP COMPARISON AWAY FROM INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR} Hows the following:
\vspace{\baselineskip}

``Using less water does not necessarily relate to safer, more effective suppression. In instances where an interior attack is choosen, more water used on the approach to the fire relates directly to safer conditions for the suppression crew (Section \ref{tc:cool_as_you_advance}). ''

\section{Water Flow Can Impact Flow Path.} \label{tc:water_impact_flowpath}
Flowpath is the volume between the air inlet and the exhaust outlet in a structure fire, where fresh air is flowing towards the base of the fire (low pressure) and products of combustion are flowing away from the fire (high pressure). Figure \ref{fig:flow_path_effect_TC_flow_path} shows an example of flow path in a single compartment where the left image is a single flow path in the door low and out the door high and right is multiple flow paths, one in the door low and out the door high and one in the door low and out the window. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Tactical_Considerations/Flow_Path_Effect/flow_path.png}

\caption[Flow Path]{Examples of flow path in a compartment, a single flow path (left) and multiple flow paths (right).}
\label{fig:flow_path_effect_TC_flow_path}
\end{figure}

Fire service hose streams have the ability to entrain air and thus create flow \cite{Weinchenk_airentrainment}. This entrainment has the potential to alter the flow path during both interior and exterior suppression tactics. A narrow fog stream moved in an `O' pattern was shown to entrain as much air as a positive pressure fan \cite{Weinchenk_airentrainment}. When a narrow fog in an `O' pattern is used during an exterior attack it has the potential to block the flow path exiting vent opening the stream is applied and re-direct the flowpath to the interior, much like a positive pressure fan would. When a straight stream or solid stream is utilized there is limited impact on the flow path. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{../0_Images/Tactical_Considerations/Flow_Path_Effect/Exterior_Fog}

\caption[Exterior Application Can Change Flowpath]{Examples of the potential to change the flow path based on the application of water from the exterior. The narrow fog (right) blocks the opening and entrains air increasing the pressure in the room, the solid stream (left) does not effect the flow path.}
\label{fig:flow_path_effect_TC_exerior_application}
\end{figure}

Hose steams can cause the same effect on the interior of the structure, similar to the exterior, understanding the effect increases the ability to use it to your benefit. Applying water down the hallway in a method which entrains air can alter the flow path such that the hot gases are no longer flowing over the heads of the firefighters as they advance. Figure \ref{fig:flow_path_effect_TC_hallwayflow} shows the ability of a advancing hose team to stop the flow of hot gases down the hallway as they advance with a `Flow \& Move technique'. It also blocks the fresh air being entrained down the hallway, limiting the growth due to the additional oxygen, however preventing fresh air from reaching the bedrooms ahead of the hose team.

\label{fig:flow_path_effect_TC_hallwayflow}
\end{figure}

\section{Speed is the enemy of re-growth}
As with the initial water application, the method used for final suppression should be based on the time it takes to preform the tactic. During an exterior attack and often some interior attacks it is often difficult to apply water under or behind obstructions such as beds, dressers, chairs and sofas. After an initial water application from the exterior, if possible the crew should attempt to place the nozzle in the ventilation opening and cool as many surfaces as possible. After cooling all surfaces that can be cooled from that position, the crew should rapidly relocate to a position which allows for complete extinguishment (most often the interior of the compartment). The fastest most direct path to that location should be utilized to limit the time between the last water application and final suppression. 

After the initial water application from the exterior it is possible the fire will still be located under and behind objects which will cause the room to re-grow while the crew positions for final suppression. Figure \ref{fig:regrowth_TC_image_sequence} shows five second increments prior, during and after a transitional attack.

\label{fig:regrowth_TC_image_sequence}
\end{figure}

Although visually the re-growth appears severe, the temperatures inside the fire compartment and in the hallway directly outside the fire compartment (Figure \ref{fig:regrowth_TC_temps}) do not show a significant increase in the 40~seconds it takes the attack team to transition from the initial exterior suppression to room suppression on the interior. The initial water application took temperatures at the 3~ft level immediately outside the fire compartment from 500~$^\circ$F to under 250~$^\circ$ allowing the attack team to move directly to the interior doorway without requiring additional water flow.

\label{fig:regrowth_TC_temps}
\end{figure}

When a transitional attack is chosen and a single hose line is going to be utilized to complete the tactic, the crew should understand the importance of rapidly relocating the handline from its exterior position after the initial knock-back to the interior for complete suppression. The faster this can be accomplished, the less the temperatures will rebound. If regrowth is a significant concern, and resources permit, maintaining the initial attack crew on the exterior position while a second handline and crew complete the interior suppression is a option to limit the re-growth. 

\section{Expansion is equivalent to contraction}
As water is heated from a liquid to a gas (evaporation) it expands 1,7000 times. This is often referred to in the fire service as `steam expansion' and the value is referenced in almost all fire service training manuals \cite{Corbett_FE_FFI_FFII} \cite{Stowell_Essentials6}. Depending on the reference this can be seen as a positive or negative effect of applying water to a fire. When looked at in a positive way, steam expansion conceptually can displace the oxygen in the compartment, smothering the fire. On the negative side, because conceptually this expansion could create pressure which in turn would move hot gases towards areas where potential occupants my be trapped. 

During fire suppression the conceptual effects of `steam expansion' are not seen when water is applied to a flashed over compartment with gypsum walls. As the `steam expansion' is occurring, the gases inside the compartment are also being rapidly cooled from as temperature exceeding 1,500~$^\circ$F to below 300$^\circ$F a reduction of approximately 1,300~$^\circ$F. The cooling gases contract more than the expansion due to steam, resulting in a net contraction of the gases in the compartment. 

Figure \ref{fig:expansion_TC_chart} shows that as the room is cooled temperatures reduce from over 1,500~$^\circ$F to below 300~$^\circ$F (green line on right axis) and as the room is cooling the average velocity at the window and doorway go from outflow (positive) to inflow (negative). Although only occurring for a few seconds, this demonstrates the net effect being contractor rather than expansion due to conversion of water to steam.

\section[Steam is a bi-product of combutsion]{Steam is a bi-product of combustion, suppressing water it not drastically increasing moisture in the environment}

THIS SECTION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.

In the presence of sufficient oxygen, fuel and provided with sufficient heat results in combustion. In the case of methane, the complete combustion results in carbon monoxide and water vapor. Although in a house fire fuels are more complex than methane. Additionally, sufficient oxygen does not exist for complete combustion thus the products of the reaction are what the fire service knows a smoke. Smoke contains things such as soot, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and water vapor among other many other substances. The water vapor created by the combustion reaction is not trivial. Figure  \hl{I was going to add a chart/table of the moisture prior to suppression followed by a chart of the moisture immeditly following suppression (the one I was working on today) to justify this. I'm not sure this is still valid}

\section{Flow vs. Shutdown} \label{tc:flow_vs_shutdown}
Hoseline advancement techniques differ from department to department, however generally two types of advancement were found through a poll of the project technical panel. The first title `Flow and Move' involved getting in a position to approach the fire down a hallway and flowing the handline while moving down the hallway towards the seat of the fire. The second titled `Shutdown and Move' involved shutting off the handline at the bale to allow the advancing suppression crew to move closer to the seat of the fire. Although this may be a tactical choice based on crew size, experience, and training, the approaches differ in how they effect the environment around and ahead of the suppression crew. 

When flowing and moving, there is a constant cooling effect for the handline both around and ahead of the advancing hose crew. When the line is shutdown to move forward the cooling effect is no longer present and temperatures begin to re-bound ahead and around the advancing crew. The temperature re-bound occurs mostly over the head of the advancing crew. If the handline is operated again within 10-15~seconds, the rebound never reaches the temperature prior to suppression. Although structural protective gear will prevent the advancing crew from feeling a change in the environment, elevated temperatures return. If the handline were not operated again, the temperature would rebound to the level prior to suppression.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent_TC}
\end{figure}

The ability of the handline to influence the flow ahead of the attack crew did not differ greatly between the two tactics. The line was capable of preventing flow over the head of the advancing suppression crew while the line was operating, once shut down the flow returned however not at the previous level and was halted again once the line was shut down.

\label{fig:Flow_vs_Shut_Single_No_Vent_Velocity_TC}
\end{figure}

Additionally neither tactic was able to make an impact on the fire compartment ahead of the suppression crew until the crew could apply water into the compartment. The ability to influence the fire compartment was directly tied to the speed of advance and not the tactic used.

\section{Large volume gas cooling requires a large volume of water}
Although small droplets of water theoretically will provide the most effective cooling of hot fire gases, in a large volume, using a combination nozzle on a wide fog setting providing pulses was not effective. Either the droplets are too large, the gases are not hot enough to take advantage of the cooling before the droplets fall to the floor out of the hot gas layer, or the gasses are being replaced too quickly due to the exhaust flow out the open door.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Pulse_95gpm/2TC}

\label{fig:gas_pulse_95_TC}
\end{figure}

The effectiveness of the cooling increased as both the flow rate and the ability of the stream to penetrate the further and reach more surfaces. The most effective method with the longest holding effect was the straight stream pattern at 150~gpm flowing in a `wall, ceiling, wall' pattern toward the fire compartment. 

 \begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{../0_Images/Script_Figures/Experiment_Analysis/Gas_Cooling/Wall_Ceiling_Wall_150gpm/2TC}

\label{fig:gas_wall_ceiling_wall_150_TC}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that water could not be applied directly into the fire compartment and the volume used to cool was significantly larger than a standard residential room. This would represent the most challenging scenario to cool the gases as they would be replaced rapidly by the constant fire source with a flow path through the compartment out the open door. Future research should be done on residential size rooms, tactics such as door control, high pressure low flow nozzles, along with the tactics used above to evaluate the effectiveness.  

\section{You Must Cool as You Advance.} \label{tc:cool_as_you_advance}
The concept that structural protective gear will protect a firefighter  as they advance the compartment of origin without applying water and that applying water prior to reaching the compartment or even entering the compartment will have consequences does not fit with modern fuel loads and fire development. The compartment of origin becomes untenable for firefighters in full protective gear once it reaches flashover. All bedroom fires reached flash over well before the initial fire department actions were preformed. Often this occurring within 4-4.5~minutes of ignition. Entering the compartment before applying water would have resulted in significant injury if not death.

Conditions outside the compartment were just as severe in terms of thermal assault to firefighters. The heat flux and temperature fall within the emergency range of their structural turnout gear, where injury is likely and the gears ability to protect the firefighter is decreased or non-existent.  Even halfway down the hallway the heat flux and temperature exceed the ordinary operating range of structural turnout gear.
