\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
As research continues into how fire department interventions affect fire dynamics in the modern fire environment; questions continue to arise on the impact and implications of interior versus exterior fire attack on both firefighter safety and occupant survivability. Previous research into various types of fire ground ventilation, flow paths, and exterior fire streams has provided the fire service with a more in-depth understanding of fire dynamics in addition to causing concern about certain fire attack methods stemming from differing traditions and myths. This knowledge gap and lack of previous research in this area has driven the need for further study into fire department interventions at structure fires with a focus on hose streams and suppression tactics. Statistics show that both firefighters and building occupants continue to loose their lives due to fire. As such, research into the various methods of fire attack will allow a broader understanding of how firefighter interventions on the fire ground can impact the outcome of both life safety and property protection. 

\vspace*{\baselineskip}

This study will build and expand upon the fire research conducted to date by analyzing how firefighting tactics, specifically suppression methods, affect the thermal exposure and survivability of both firefighters and building occupants in addition to impacting fire behavior in structures. The purpose of this study is to improve firefighter safety, fireground tactics, and the knowledge of fire dynamics by providing the fire service with credible scientific information, developed from both water flow and full-scale fire testing, in representative single family homes. The project will be comprised of 3 parts:
\vspace*{\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Part I:  Water Distribution
	\item Part II: Air Entrainment
	\item Part III: Full-Scale Residential Fire Experiments
	\end{itemize}
\vspace*{\baselineskip}

This report details the results and analysis from the air entrainment testing. These tests were conducted without the presence of fire to gain a fundamental understanding of how hose streams entrain air. Each set of experiments was intended to add to the understanding of air entrainment and pressure from fire service hose streams by evaluating the differences caused by various application methods, hose stream types, nozzle movements, pressures/flow rates, manufacturers, and ventilation configurations.

\chapter{Background}

Firefighter research has highlighted the need to apply water to the fire as quickly as possible from the safest and most tactically efficient location available~\cite{DHS2008,DHS2010,DHS2011}. This includes the option to apply water to the fire from the exterior of the structure; a tactic that was long said to be dangerous for civilian occupants and firefighters alike. As the possibility of utilizing an exterior attack as an offensive operation gained exposure, a knowledge gap was highlighted within the firefighting community which increased the interest in better understanding the impact of water applied as part of either an interior or exterior attack. Many variables exist in fire attack which have a direct impact on victim survivability, firefighter safety, and the overall effectiveness of the operation including: the time required to get water on the fire, hose stream type, placement, and movement, air entrainment, steam development, hot gas cooling and contraction, ventilation, and the position of flow paths within the structure. Additionally, firefighters have the ability to make tactical choices on the fire ground which directly affect not only the outcome of the operation but the safety of both civilians and firefighters alike. These choices range from ``big picture'' decisions on strategies and tactics (i.e. methods of fire attack) down to smaller-scale decisions regarding the tools utilized for suppression operations (i.e. hose lines, nozzles, and hose streams). It is critical that firefighters understand how their tools can impact the fire behavior and air flows within a structure and what impact this may have on suppression operations as well as any implications to victim survivability or firefighter safety.

\section*{Fire Service Training}

Current firefighter training manuals fail to highlight the importance of air entrainment from hose streams on both fire behavior and air flows within a structure. Seeing as little research has been done to date, the effects of changing nozzles, hose stream types, and nozzle movements is unknown and speculative at best. During the course of training for a firefighter, they are instructed on the construction, mechanics, and operation of different types of nozzles. Additionally, the various types of hose streams and the associated risks and benefits are discussed. However, there is no mention of the ability of different nozzles and hose streams to affect the air flows within a structure based on a given tactic and hand line set-up. This has been a key component missing from firefighter training for decades. It is imperative that the firefighter operating the nozzle understand how their tools impact their working environment. 

Nearly every firefighter training manual introduces the concept of hydraulic ventilation in which the nozzle firefighter is several feet back from an opening within the structure and directs a fog stream from the interior to the exterior of the compartment~\cite{Essentials6,FEHandbook}. The fog stream is intended to fill the majority of the ventilation opening. It is discussed that the stream passing through the opening will draw smoke from the compartment and/or remaining parts of the structure to provide ventilation post fire knockdown. The concept of hydraulic ventilation implies that a hose stream entrains air; however, there is no direct mention that the smoke is being entrained into the hose stream. The lack of inclusion of air entrainment in firefighter training manuals leaves the firefighter with only a partial understanding of why hydraulic ventilation occurs and omits a critical piece understanding the operations and implications of various nozzles and hose stream types. Additionally, several firefighter training manuals mention that if a smooth bore nozzle is used during suppression operations, hydraulic ventilation can still be achieved. It is stated that a smooth bore nozzle can be cracked to half or partial bail to create a coarse or broken stream, filling the ventilation opening, and drawing smoke with it. Some manuals even go so far as to say that smooth bore nozzles should be rotated within the window opening to increase the amount of smoke removed from the compartment~\cite{FEHandbook}, implying that increasing nozzle movement increases the amount of air entrained. Firefighter training manuals need to include the concept of air entrainment in hose streams into the discussion of nozzles, hose stream types, and nozzle movements. The implication of air entrainment should not just lie in a discussion of hydraulic ventilation within a ventilation chapter.

\section*{Previous Research}

A series of initial air entrainment experiments was conducted at the Rockland County, NY Fire Training Center in 2002 in attempts to quantify the amount of air moved by various nozzles~\cite{KnappNozzles1}. Three fire service professionals: Jerry Knapp, Tim Pillsworth, and Sean White recognized the need for the nozzle firefighter to understand what happens to the fire conditions in the building as a result of their water application. It was noted that the effects of the nozzle, stream pattern, and associated air movement often go unseen as the environment is filled with smoke limiting visibility. This was the first of its kind in which the nozzles were flowed in typical fireground methods and the air moved was captured. Ventilation was provided both behind and in front of the nozzle operator. The test fixture was a modular shipping container, divided by a draft wall in which an airflow-measuring device was placed as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Rockland_County_Test_Setup}. The device measured velocity and volumetric flow and was re-purposed from HVAC installation and duct balancing to be utilized here. Tests were performed looking at nozzle type, hose stream type, nozzle movements, and distance from the ventilation opening. As a result, some of the first conclusions were drawn regarding air entrainment in hose streams. The tests showed that smooth bore nozzles entrained the least amount of air, followed by straight streams and fog streams from a combination nozzle. It was also seen that increasing the distance from the nozzle to the ventilation opening increased the entrainment within the hose stream. Additionally, rotating the nozzle in a clockwise fashion increased the entrainment was well~\cite{KnappNozzles1,KnappNozzles2,KnappNozzles3}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\label{fig:Rockland_County_Test_Setup}
\end{figure}

Engineers with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted research on the impact of hose streams on air flows inside a structure through seven experimental series at the Delaware County Emergency Services Training Center in Sharon Hill, PA~\cite{NISTHoseStreams}. Experiments were performed which looked at various hose stream types, including a straight stream, a narrow fog stream, and a wide fog stream from a combination nozzle as well as a solid stream from a smooth bore nozzle. Nozzle movements included fixed, sweeping, and rotational patterns. The gas velocity was measured in the flow path through the use of bi-directional probes to collect both velocity and air flow rate data. It was determined that both the type of hose stream and application pattern are the critical factors when analyzing the impact to air flows inside a structure. Similar to the results found from the Rockland County experiments, it was concluded that a solid stream entrains less air than a straight stream nozzle which entrains less air than a fog pattern of varying widths. Additionally, it was found that moving and/or rotating the nozzle entrains more air than a fixed stream as seen before. 

The fire attack study is intended to close the knowledge gap and provide both context and substantiation to fire suppression methods, tools, and tactics that have been utilized for decades. The results from this study will provide the fire service with scientific based knowledge on the impact of both interior and exterior fire attack on victim survivability and firefighter safety. Part II of the study, examining air entrainment in hose streams, is the second of two series of experiments looking at the mechanics of hose streams without the presence of fire. The is intended to provide the fire service with a knowledge base into how nozzles distribute water via different hose stream types, nozzle movements, and attack locations in addition to quantifying how nozzles entrain and move air throughout a structure. By developing data in realistic structures utilizing modern fuel sources and fire scenarios, important inferences may be developed relative to different nozzles, hose stream types, techniques, and the overall use of water for fire suppression operations.

\chapter{Objectives}

The purpose of this part to the overall study was to provide the fire service with scientific based knowledge on the impact of air entrainment in hose streams during interior and exterior fire attack on firefighter safety and the survivability of trapped occupants. This was accomplished with the completion of the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve firefighter safety by increasing knowledge of air entrainment by hose streams.
	\item Quantify air entrainment of typical fire service nozzles. 
	\item Develop knowledge of how manufacturer, hose stream type, pressure, flow rate, and nozzle movement effect air entrainment.
	\item Develop and disseminate knowledge of how tactical choices such as ventilation, attack method, and nozzle movement effect air entrainment. 
	\end{itemize}

% \chapter{Previous Literature}

% At the start of the study, a literature review was performed to identify and analyze the following:

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Previous research in the field of air entrainment.
% 	\item Both past and current fire suppression tactics.
% 	\item Knowledge gaps in fire suppression operations. (choice of tactics, myths, traditions, etc.) 
% \end{itemize}

% The following section outlines some of the material as it relates to the fire attack study. The literature review encompassed past research work, various articles in fire service publications, fire service training manuals, as well as fire department standard operating procedures to highlight some of the critical areas of information which drove the project at hand.

% \hl{NEED TO ADD REFERENCES AND REVIEW IF THESE APPLY TO AIR ENTRAINMENT, PLACING THEM IN THE CATAGORIES BELOW}

% Hose, nozzles and water have been used by the fire service for hundreds of years. Despite their frequent use, there has been little scientific research conducted on the effective use of these tools for fire suppression. It is common in the fire service to find discussions about which nozzle is better or which flow rate is required for what sized fire but this is based on experience and usually not science. 

% In 1950 Chief Lloyd Layman presented a paper titled “Little Drops of Water” at the Fire Department Instructors Conference. He introduced what he called indirect method of attack to suppress interior building fires by using the heat absorbing properties of expanding and condensing steam, produced in great quantities by fog streams. The conclusions were based on Coast Guard experiments that Layman was in charge of conducting at the Coast Guard Firefighting School at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, MD. Layman continued his experiments after he returned to his position as fire chief in Parkersburg, WV where he applied his tactic in building fires.  This research had a very large impact on the fire service and their suppression techniques to this day. 

% Throughout the 1950’s a National Committee began conducting experiments to collect data on the growth and behavior of interior fires and how to most effectively suppress them. Keith Royer and Bill Nelson were members of this committee, and as the heads of the firemanship training program at the Iowa State University’s Engineering Extension, they collected and analyzed data from hundreds of experimental fires. Through this research the fire service was taught about fire behavior and how to suppress fire with a combination fire attack. They examined the amount of heat generated by common fuels, the heat absorbing capacity of water, the impact of compartment volume during suppression and they developed the Iowa formula. The Iowa formula or critical rate of flow formula is still used today and it determines the amount of water needed to control a fire in the largest open space within a structure by dividing the cubic foot volume of the space by 100.

% While the physics of fire development has not changed over time, the fire environment for specifically the single family home has evolved. Several factors including home size, geometry, contents and construction materials have changed significantly over the past 50 or more years. Each of these factors has impacted firefighter and occupant safety. Faster fire propagation, shorter times to flashover, rapid changes in fire dynamics and shorter escape times all impact fire service suppression techniques and effectiveness. Many of the variables in Royer and Nelson’s analysis have changed and more research is needed to see how suppression techniques used in the 1950’s with 1950’s fuel loads and firefighting tools translates to today’s firefighter safety and effectiveness.

% Beginning in 1994, the Naval Research Laboratory carried out a series of full-scale fire experiments to compare straight stream attack versus fog pattern attack. These experiments were conducted on the Navy ship ex-USS Shadwell with a fire volume of approximately 110~m$^3$. In these experiments one 60 degree fog pattern was applied at a 45 degree angle into the smoke layer. They examined cooling effects, steam generation and thermal layer disruption. Their experiments examined shielded and non-shielded fires and concluded that using fog to cool the upper layer was more effective and safer than straight stream attack when the fire could not be attacked directly and the firefighters heart rates and body temperatures were lower utilizing the fog attack.

% In 1998 NIST conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate the suppression effectiveness of water-based firefighting agents. This was a step toward creating test procedures to determine suppression effectiveness to develop a standardized test method for evaluating the fire fighting effectiveness of water and other agents. This study provides preliminary data upon which firefighting effectiveness test may be developed by it suggests additional research on application technique, tests reflective of the complexities found in firefighting and experiments involving structural-fire suppression.  

% In 2002, The National Research Council of Canada conducted a literature search on 3D water fog techniques for firefighting. It discusses the impact of water fog characteristics associated with properties of the nozzle (e,g,, droplet size, momentum, flow rate, spray angle and pattern) and discharge techniques (e.g., discharge angle, and discharge duration related to the bursts) on performance of the 3D water fog technique are discussed. This technique is to supplement a direct attack by controlling the environment the firefighters are in until they are in a position to apply water directly to the fire. Opponents of flowing water into smoke have concerns that include: (i) effectiveness of controlling the fire, compared to traditional straight stream attack; (ii) possible disruption of the thermal balance; (iii) possible generation of a large amount of hot steam that produces burn injuries to firefighters; and (iv) the performance of this technique is complex and requires extensive training. Advocates of this technique have attempted to respond to these concerns but very limited experimental studies have been undertaken do to complexity of the problems. Application techniques and fire conditions on the the performance of fog technique is not well studied and therefore there are little guidelines and adoption will be greatly limited.

% Several theoretical studies had been conducted that examine droplet size and their ability to suppress fire gases. For example, when droplet diameter is reduced from 1000 nanometers to 100 nanometers the total surface area increases 10 times from 6 m2 to 60 m2 for 1 liter of water. Since these smaller droplets evaporate sooner, others have examined the lifetime of the droplet to determine how far it can travel based on temperature of the surrounding gases and droplet size. Further complicating this theory is that droplets all have an impact on each other as they turn to steam. Residence time can be further reduced compared to an individual droplet, because leading droplets impart forward momentum to the surrounding gas, reducing the air drag on the following droplets and resulting in better penetration. In 2010, the University of Maryland examined spray characteristics from fire hose nozzles. They examined the breakup of a smooth bore nozzle utilizing techniques such as shadowgraphy and a patternator and concluded that more research was needed to fully understand the water spray from fire hose nozzles.  

% In 2000, Lund University examined the demand for extinguishing media in manual firefighting. They examined critical flow rates required to suppress fires by reviewing available literature and conducted a series of experiments that examined suppression of wood pallets at a fire training academy. They examined the five ways that water can be applied during fire extiguishment, on hot gases, on flames, on burning fuel, on fuel that is not yet burning and on hot surfaces. They highlight that what is most effective against the fire is not necessarily best for the firefighters since there are other constraints during firefighting operations such as limited air supply and multiple priorities. The optimum flow rate corresponds to an optimum control time, a control time that gives the lowest total demand for resources. Most of the current data for optimum water flow rate include experiments utilizing wood cribs or pallets, but not todays synthetic fuel loads in actual structures.  These studies also did not investigate the effect of flow paths or the impact of steam generation on firefighters or victims.

% In 2003, a fire service group at the Rockland County (NY) Fire Training Center conducted a series of tests in their concrete training building. They measured the amount of air moved by solid bore and combination nozzles using common fire ground methods. They concluded that air volumes moved by smooth bore nozzles and combination nozzles in the straight stream setting are very similar if not the same, and that combination nozzles in the fog pattern move significant amounts of air which can over pressurize the fire area and send steam over the attack crew even with a ventilation opening opposite the attack crew. These tests were performed either with no fire or with a training fire but which are very different than actual fire conditions. Their tests do provide a good range of airflows that can be expected in our experiments. The authors state, “Our nozzle testing program was not as controlled and as precise as we would have liked.” They also did not have measurement devices that were able to accurately measure air flows from a fog pattern.  

% The Firefighting Technology Group at NIST has a current project that is examining hose streams. This project examines a variety of fire fighting hose stream characteristics related to flow, distribution and thermal impact from both solid and fog stream nozzles. A series of real scale, laboratory based experiments have been started to look specifically at the water discharge and distribution characteristics, the impact of hose streams on a hot gas layer in a compartment, the impact of hose streams on gas flows through multi-compartment structures, and the suppression effectiveness on burning piles of wooden pallets. The proposed project will build on their results by utilizing real-scale structures with common residential fuels and making additional measurements to better characterize the impact of flow path, nozzle technique and steam generation on fire dynamics, firefighter exposure and occupant survivability.

\chapter{Experimental Configuration}

\section{Test Facility}

The air entrainment testing was conducted at the Delaware County Emergency Services Training Center in Sharon Hill, PA. A two-story concrete structure was built on a concrete slab as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Delaware_County,_PA_Fire_Test_Structure}. It was designed to simulate a representative residential structure. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/delcocorner.jpg}
	\caption{Delaware County, PA Fire Test Structure}
	\label{fig:Delaware_County,_PA_Fire_Test_Structure}
\end{figure}

The outer walls of the first floor of the structure were composed of interlocking concrete blocks 2~ft. wide, 2~ft. high, and 4~ft. long. The interior dimensions of the structure were 20~ft. wide, 36~ft. long, and 8~ft. high. The joints and gaps between the blocks were filled with high temperature insulation. The interior walls of the first floor were framed with steel studs set to 16~in. centers and track and were lined with 0.5~in. thick cement board. The walls were composed of 0.6~in. Type X gypsum board. Additionally, the ceiling was composed of two layers of 0.5~in. thick cement board. The first floor ceiling support of the structure was composed of wood truss joist I-beams (TJIs) with a 11.75~in. depth. Each TJI was composed of laminated veneer lumber flanges with a cross section of 1.13~in. x 1.75~in. and an 0.43~in. thick oriented strand board web. Tongue and groove oriented strand board of 0.72~in. thickness was screwed to the top of the TJIs. 

A stairwell was built to connect the two floors of the structure. The stairs had a 7.25~in rise and 7.5~in run and started 5.25~ft off the south wall with a width of 14~ft off the east wall. The second story walls were wood framed with 2~in by 4~in studs. The studs were set to 16~in centers. The interior walls were protected by 0.63~in fire rated gypsum board, 0.63~in Durock board, and a second layer of 0.63~in fire rated gypsum board. The exterior walls were protected with 0.31~in oriented strand board and 0.31~in fiber cement lap siding. Dimensioned drawings of the first and second floor are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:Delaware_County,_PA_Fire_Test_Structure_First_Floor} and \ref{fig:Delaware_County,_PA_Fire_Test_Structure_Second_Floor} respectively.

\end{figure}

The exterior doorways of each structure were steel doors that were opened or closed at certain instances during tests to change the ventilation configuration within the structure. All other doorways in the structures did not contain a door. If it was determined that these doors needed closed during a test, a sheet of either gypsum board or oriented strand board was used to cover the opening and remained as such until the conclusion of the given test.

% A series of the air entrainment experiments involved a reconfiguration of the first floor of the structure. An interior dividing wall was constructed 10~ft-4~in. from the North wall the to compartmentalize th first floor. A standard 2~ft. 6~in. by 6~ft. 8~in. doorway was created 17~ft off the East wall to join the compartments. A 16~ft interior wall was added to the dividing wall to create a a hallway along the West side of the structure that was 16~ft by 4~ft. This allowed for the team to study entrainment in a structure configuration most comparable to residential single family homes.

These experiments involved the repetition of nozzle movements and patterns; therefore to minimize nozzle operator fatigue and improve repeatability a nozzle prop was constructed. The prop was used as the `backup' firefighter by supporting the hoseline and minimizing nozzle reaction forces on the operator. Figure~\ref{fig:Nozzle_Prop} shows a dimensioned drawing and the constructed prop. The horizontal base and vertical member were constructed of 4'' by 4'' dimensioned lumber while the angled supports were constructed of 2'' by 6'' dimensioned lumber.

The hose was affixed to the prop with `U' bolts and locking nuts to ensure the hose did not move during an experiment. The prop supported both 1.5~in. and 2.5~in. hoselines. To ensure the experiments were consistent (independent of variance of nozzle position on the prop), the distance from the nozzle to the ventilation opening was measured from the tip of the nozzle, and not the base of the prop.

\section{Instrumentation and Uncertainty}
\label{sec:uncert}
Gas velocity, a measure of air entrainment by hose streams, was obtained through the use of an array of bi-directional probes. Bi-directional probes were connected to a pressure transducers to evaluate the change in pressure associated with the gas flow. The differential pressure transducer was a Setra Model 264 with a range of +/- 0.5~in. WC (+/- 124.5~Pa.). The uncertainty given by the manufacturer is 1\% or 1.2~Pa. 

A gas velocity measurement study examining the doorway flow of pre-flashover compartment fires yielded expanded uncertainty measurements ranging from $\pm$~0.14 to $\pm$~0.22 for bi-directional probes of similar design~\cite{Bryant:FSJ2009}. The total expanded uncertainty for gas velocity in these experiments is estimated to be $\pm$~18~\%.

\section{Measurement Location}
\label{sec:location}
There were several challenges associated with measuring air entrainment from hose streams. The first challenge existed because the experiments were conducted outside, therefore considering wind was critical. Additionally, the instrumentation used in data collection is best in a dry environment to maintain the smallest level of uncertainty and remain operational. To address these challenges, the measurement location was set at the doorway at the top of the stairwell. Figure~\ref{fig:Measurement_Location_Second_Floor} shows the position of the the bi-direction probe array on the second floor.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/Measurement_Locations_Secondfloor}

	\label{fig:Measurement_Location_Second_Floor}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:Air_Entrainment_Flowpath_Interior_Experiments} and \ref{fig:Air_Entrainment_Flowpath_Exterior_Experiments} show the experimental configuration for the interior flow tests and exterior flow tests, respectively. The arrows indicate the flow direction based on the hose stream being the source of the flow through air entrainment.

	\label{fig:Air_Entrainment_Flowpath_Exterior_Experiments}
\end{figure}

The measurement location was placed at the top of the stairs, within the flow path of both test configurations. This location kept the instrumentation dry and out of the reach of a hose stream. While this location did not guarantee isolation from wind effects due to open vents, this represented the best location to minimize those effects.

\section{Flow Locations}

For the base configuration of the experimental facility (Figures~\ref{fig:Delaware_County,_PA_Fire_Test_Structure_First_Floor} and \ref{fig:Delaware_County,_PA_Fire_Test_Structure_Second_Floor}), there were two main locations where the hoses were placed to flow water: interior and exterior. For an interior test, the nozzle was set to be 12~ft from the doorway on the first floor of the structure and water flowed from that position through the open vent, out of the structure (Figure~\ref{fig:First_Floor_Setup_Total_Entrainment_Interior_Tests}). For the exterior tests, the nozzle was again set 12~ft from the first floor doorway but water flowed from the exterior of structure through the vent into the first floor of the structure (Figure~\ref{fig:First_Floor_Setup_Total_Entrainment_Exterior_Tests}). This had the global effect of either pulling air passed the measurement array on the second floor or pushing air passed the the measurement array for the interior and exterior locations respectively.

% The air entrainment experiments that involved the reconfiguration the first floor of the structure (Figure~\ref{fig:First_Floor_Alterations_Room_Configuration}) were also interior tests (water was flown from the inside of the structure to the outside). These experiments featured both a fixed position nozzle and advancing nozzle position (moving toward the exit along the interior hallway). Figure~\ref{fig:First_Floor_Setup_Total_Entrainment_Exterior_Tests} shows the fixed position of the nozzle and the open vents. For advancing experiments, the nozzle moved toward the open door.

\chapter{Experiments Conducted}

Experiments were completed to determine how air entrainment from hose streams was affected by varying several parameters. In each experimental configuration, water flowed for approximately 60~s. An average velocity was calculated at the measurement location (Section~\ref{sec:location}) using the bi-directional probes and the average velocity multiplied by the measurement area to calculate a volumetric flow rate in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To compare different configurations, an average flow rate was calculated over the duration for each specific configuration. Figure~\ref{fig:cfmplotexplainer} shows the entrained air in volumetric flow as a function of time (dashed line) and the time-averaged flow rate between `events' (solid line). The time-averaged value was calculated between each event call-out and the value is tied to the event call-out on the left side of the interval. During each test, approximately 60~s of background data was taken so the ambient conditions could be isolated from experimental data. After ambient fluctuations were accounted for, the average volumetric flow during the background event was approximately 0~CFM. When the straight stream flow was started in Figure~\ref{fig:cfmplotexplainer}, the average CFM during that event jumped to approximately 1700~CFM. Note that while the transient (dashed) data shows fluctuations typical of velocity data, the magnitudes of the fluctuations did not prevent distinct events from being distinguishable.

\label{fig:cfmplotexplainer}
\end{figure}

Based on the discussion in Section~\ref{sec:uncert}, the uncertainty associated with measurements from the bi-directional probes is $\pm$~18~\%. Therefore, the time-averaged air entrainment data has uncertainty bars included (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:cfmbarexplainer}). For the data where the the uncertainty bars overlap, such as those in the Figure~\ref{fig:cfmbarexplainer}, the differences between the CFM averages cannot be differentiated.

The  ventilation configuration of the structure used open double doors on the first and second floor. With this structure configuration, the hose stream type, nozzle pattern, flow location, flowrate and pressure, and hoseline size diameter were varied.

\section{Manufacturer Comparison}
\label{sec:manu}

Experiments varying pressure/flow rate, hose stream type, and nozzle movement were conducted to quantify potential differences in air entrainment associated with using three three different manufacturer's nozzles (MFI, MFII, and MFIII). Table~\ref{tab:Manufacturer_Comparison_Experiments} shows the configurations examined. For all three hose stream types, both a fixed pattern and an `O' pattern were used from the interior position.

Figure~\ref{fig:1_5_Interior_Combination_Manufacturer} shows the average flow rate (CFM) for both the straight stream and narrow fog hose stream types with fixed and `O' patterns under three different pressures: 50~psi, 75~psi, and 100~psi. Figure~\ref{fig:1_5_Interior_Smooth_Bore_Manufacturer} shows the average flow rate for three smooth bore nozzles; a 7/8~in. tip with 150~gpm at 50~psi, a 15/16~in. tip with 180~gpm at 50~psi, and a 1~in. tip with 210~gpm at 50~psi for both a fixed and `O' pattern.

\end{figure}

For the straight streams and narrow fog streams with both fixed patterns and `O' patterns, Figure~\ref{fig:1_5_Interior_Combination_Manufacturer}, the air entrainment for the three manufacturers was within the experimental uncertainty of the measurement for all three pressures. For the smooth bore streams, the three manufactures were generally within the experimental uncertainty of the air entrainment measurements (Figure~\ref{fig:1_5_Interior_Smooth_Bore_Manufacturer}). MFI had slightly lower average CFM for a fixed stream with 15/16~in. tip with 180~gpm at 50~psi and an `O' Pattern with a 1~in. tip with 210~gpm at 50~psi. While these two cases had lower average air entrainment, when assessing the magnitude of the differences over the set of comparisons made, the three manufacturers are similar. As a result, the experiments designed to assess the configuration variables all used nozzles from MFI.

% \section{Ventilation Configuration}

% The second series of experiments conducted to analyze air entrainment in hose streams involved varying the ventilation configurations within the structure. The inlet and exhaust of the structure were varied between different sized doors and windows to quantify ventilation effects on air entrainment. The tests were conducted from both the interior and the exterior positions (Section~\ref{sec:location}) of the structure with a fixed setback distance of 12~ft. from the ventilation opening.

% Table~\ref{tab:Vent_Sizes} shows the width and height of the ventilation configuration options. The main ventilation openings were a single and double door as well as a single and double window. Additionally, a controlled door was evaluated to show the impact of a reduced inlet size on the total air entrainment in hose streams. This is a common practice among fire departments based on previous research conducted showing the impact of closing down the flow path on changing air flow within a structure.

\chapter{Results}

The intent of the air entrainment experiments was to determine the average volumetric flow of air (CFM) within the compartment as a function of several common fire service nozzle configurations and application locations. Recall, the location of the air entrainment measurement within the compartment was achieved using an array of bi-directional probes (Section~\ref{sec:location}).

\section{Comparison of Impact of Hose Stream Type}

The hose stream type comparison experiments were designed to quantify differences in average air entrainment in cubic feet per minute (CFM) from a straight stream, smooth bore stream, and a narrow fog stream. From the interior position, the three hose stream types were compared with a fixed pattern and an `O' to determine differences from a static (fixed pattern) flow and if moving the stream (`O' pattern) changed the relationship between the stream types. Figures~\ref{fig:hosestream_type} and \ref{fig:hosestream_type_o} show the average air entrainment values for the fixed pattern and `O' pattern hose stream comparisons, respectively.

	\label{fig:hosestream_type_o}
\end{figure}


In both the fixed and `O' pattern comparisons, the smooth bore stream and straight stream have similar values of air entrainment, within the measurement uncertainty. For the fixed pattern, the narrow fog entrainment approximately 6 times as much air as the straight stream and smooth bore stream. The straight stream and smooth bore stream also had similar air entrainment values with an `O' pattern compared to the narrow fog which entrained approximately 2.5 times more air. Note that with the `O' pattern, all three hose streams had increased air entrainment. Further discussion of nozzle movement is included in Section~\ref{sec:movement}). Finally, observe that the fixed pattern narrow fog still entrained approximately 2 times more air than the smooth bore stream and straight stream with an `O' pattern.

\section{Comparison of Impact of Nozzle Movement}
\label{sec:movement}

Common nozzle movements used in the fire service are the `O', `Z', and `n' patterns. Differences in the patterns were examined using a straight stream and narrow fog stream from combination nozzle as well as a smooth bore nozzle. The experiments were conducted from the interior position at a fixed setback distance of 12~ft from the external vent. For the smooth bore stream, straight stream and narrow fog stream, a fixed nozzle pattern was compared to an `O' pattern. The combination nozzle flowed 150~gpm at 50~psi and to have an equivalent flow from the smooth bore nozzle, a 7/8~in. tip was used. Figure~\ref{fig:SB_SS_NF_Movement_Comparison} shows the average air entrainment (CFM) for a fixed pattern stream compared to a stream with an `O' pattern for the three hose stream types.

\label{fig:SB_SS_NF_Movement_Comparison}
\end{figure}

These experiments showed that for both the straight stream and smooth bore stream, when moved, the air entrainment was approximately 3.5 times more air compared to the fixed pattern. For the narrow fog stream, Figure~\ref{fig:SB_SS_NF_Movement_Comparison} shows that the `O' pattern stream had a higher average air entrainment compared to fixed pattern. However, the values fall within the measurement uncertainty and therefore a definitive conclusions about the differences between the fixed and `O' pattern cannot be drawn. 

Additionally, for both the straight stream and smooth bore stream, air entrainment from `O', `Z', and `n' patterns were compared to quantity the potential impact that movement pattern could have. Figure~\ref{fig:SS_SB_Movement_Comparison} shows the average air entrainment for the three movement patterns for a smooth bore stream and straight stream.

\label{fig:SS_SB_Movement_Comparison}
\end{figure}

The experiments showed that for both the straight stream and smooth bore stream that the movement pattern of nozzle had little noticeable impact on air entrainment as all three patterns resulted in similar volumetric flows of air through the measurement location. To further test nozzle movement, an `O' pattern was compared to `Spray and Pray' technique in which the nozzle operator moved the hose stream across the ventilation opening as fast as possible with no discernible pattern. Figure~\ref{fig:Nozzle_Movement_PatterntoNoPattern_Comparison} shows the comparison between the `O' pattern and `Spray and Pray' for a 1~in. smooth bore nozzle that flowed 210~gpm at 50~psi and that the nozzle pattern does not impact the magnitude of air entrainment.

\label{fig:Nozzle_Movement_PatterntoNoPattern_Comparison}
\end{figure}

The final nozzle movement experiments were conducted to quantify potential differences in air entrainment when a smooth bore nozzle with a flow rate of 210~gpm and pressure of 50~psi was rotated with a `O' pattern at different rotation speeds. Using a metronome, the `O' pattern was applied at 50, 100, and 150 revolutions per minute. This test was conducted at the same interior setback distance of 12~ft. from the tip of the nozzle to the ventilation opening.

\caption[Air Entrainment Comparison of Pattern Rotation Rate]{Air entrainment comparison of `O' pattern rotation rate for a 1~in. smooth bore nozzle.}
\label{fig:Nozzle_Movement_RotationSpeed_Comparison}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Nozzle_Movement_RotationSpeed_Comparison}, an increase in the rotation speed while applying a specified pattern yielded an increase in the air entrainment seen within the stream. Note that while there is overlap in the measurement uncertainty between 50~rpm versus 100~rpm and 100~rpm versus 150~rpm, since there is a distinct difference between 50~rpm and 150~rpm there exists confidence to conclude that nozzle rotation speed following the same pattern can entrainment additional air.

\section{Comparison of Impact of Pressure and Flow Rate}

The range of operating pressure and flow rate varies within the fire service due to need (potential fire hazard), equipment, and/or preference to name a few reasons. To determine how changes in pressure and/or flow rate influence air entrainment, experiments were conducted to quanitify this impact. From the interior position (recall Section~\ref{sec:location}), a straight stream and narrow fog stream from a combination nozzle connected to a 1~3/4~in. hoseline examined 4 flow rates and a smooth bore stream also connected to a 1~3/4~in. hoseline examined 3 flow rates. Figures~\ref{fig:SS_NF_FlowRate_Int} and \ref{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int} show the impact of flowrate changes for the combination nozzle experiments and smooth bore nozzle experiments respectively.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int}
\end{figure}

The average air entrainment values for the straight stream and narrow fog stream in Figure~\ref{fig:SS_NF_FlowRate_Int} were consistent for the 150~gpm flowrate at 50~psi, 75~psi, and 100~psi as well as the 95~gpm flowrate at 100~psi. For the experiments where the nozzle was rotated in an `O' pattern, the air entrainment was also similar for both hose stream types. In the the case of the narrow fog stream with the `O' pattern, the 150~gpm flowrate at 100~psi had a higher average air flow rate, however the value still fell within the measurement uncertainty range of the other three flowrate conditions. The smooth bore stream also showed minimal variation as a function of the three flow rates tested: 150~gpm, 180~gpm, and 210~gpm all at 50~psi (Figure~\ref{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int}) for both a fixed and 'O' pattern. To further assess the impact of pressure and flowrate, Figures~\ref{fig:SS_NF_FlowRate_Int_2_5} and \ref{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int_2_5} show the average air entrainment for the interior position with a 2~1/2~in. hoseline for a combination nozzle and smooth bore nozzle.

\label{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int_2_5}
\end{figure}

Similar to the 1~3/4~in. hoseline, there was negligible impact on the average air entrainment when changing pressure and flow rate for the 2~1/2~in. hoseline. For the straight stream and narrow fog stream increasing the pressure from 50~psi to 75~psi to 100~psi for a 250~gpm flow, the average air entrainment values had minimal change. The fixed nozzle pattern for the smooth bore nozzle showed an increase for the 320~gpm flow at 50~psi compared to the 260~gpm at 50~psi, however when an `O' pattern was applied, the average air entrainment values were similar (within the experimental uncertainty).

To complete the assessment of the impact of flowrate and pressure on air entrainment from the interior position, the results from 1~3/4~in. hoseline experiments were compared against those that used a 2~1/2~in. hoseline. Figures~\ref{fig:SS_NF_1_5_2_5_Int} and \ref{fig:SB_1_5_2_5_Int} show the comparison between the two hoselines for a combination nozzle and smooth bore nozzle, respectively.

\label{fig:SB_1_5_2_5_Int}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:SS_NF_1_5_2_5_Int}, the average air entrainment from a 1~3/4~in. hose line with a combination nozzle that flowed 150~gpm at 50~psi was compared to a 2~1/2~in hoseline with a combination nozzle that flowed 250~gpm at 50~psi. Straight streams and narrow fog streams were analyzed for a fixed pattern as well as an `O' pattern. In all four cases, the increase in flow rate from the larger supply line had negligible increase in air entrainment as all average values were within the measurement uncertainty of each other. Figure~\ref{fig:SB_1_5_2_5_Int} shows the comparison of average air entrainment for a 15/16~in tip smooth bore on a 1~3/~4~in. hoseline that flowed 180~gpm at 50~psi to a 1~1/4~in. tip smooth bore on a 2~1/2~in. hoseline that flowed 320~gpm at 50~psi. Similar to the two flowrates with the fixed pattern smooth bore in Figure~\ref{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int_2_5}, the 320~gpm at 50~psi configuration had a higher average air entrainment flow compared to the lesser flowrate, in this case 180~gpm at 50~psi. Comparison of the 180~gpm at 50~psi in Figure~\ref{fig:SB_1_5_2_5_Int} to the 260~gpm at 50~psi in Figure~\ref{fig:SB_Flowrate_Int_2_5}, shows that those two cases are similar and that the hoseline size does not necessarily mean there will be an increase in air entrainment. The `O' pattern shows air entrainment values which are similar for the two hoseline sizes

For an exterior position, a smooth bore stream from a 1~3/4~in. hoseline with a 15/16~in. tip that flowed 180~gpm at 50~psi was compared to smooth bore stream with a 1~1/4~in. tip on a 2~1/2~in. hoseline that flowed 320~gpm at 50~psi. The purpose of this comparison was to ensure that a change in flowrate was consistent as a function of flow position. Figure~\ref{fig:SB_Flowrate_Hoseline_Exterior} shows the two smooth bore streams for a fixed pattern and `O' pattern.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{Script_Figures/Entrainment/1_5_2_5_Smooth_Bore_Nozzle_Exterior}
\caption[Air Entrainment Comparison of Exterior Smooth Bore Nozzle from 1~3/4~in Line to 2~1/2~in. Line]{Air entrainment comparison of smooth bore nozzle flow rate and pressure from exterior position with a 1~3/4~in. line (180~gpm at 50~psi) to a 2~1/2~in line (320~gpm at 50~psi).}
\label{fig:SB_Flowrate_Hoseline_Exterior}
\end{figure}

Similar to the interior experiments, the change in flowrate associated with increasing the hoseline size and tip size for a smooth bore stream did not have a measurable difference (values were within measurement uncertainty). Also, comparable to the interior experiments, the rotation of the stream in an `O' pattern increased the air entrainment similarly for both flowrates.


% \section{Comparison of Impact of Structure Ventilation}

% Changes were made to the structure openings to examine the impact of the ventilation opening ahead of or behind the stream for both interior and exterior locations. 

% After the air entrainment testing was complete and the results were analyzed, several conclusions were drawn:

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Air entrainment is dependent on hose stream type. (smooth bore, straight stream, fog)
% 	\item Air entrainment is dependent on structure size, compartmentation, and ventilation configurations.
% 	\item Increases in nozzle movement increase overall air entrainment.
% 	\item Different nozzle movement patterns have little effect on overall air entrainment. (O, T, Z, inverted U)
% 	\item Air entrainment, either into or out of the structure, is dependent on the horizontal distance of the nozzle to the ventilation opening.
% \end{itemize}

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Understanding the Basics of Air Entrainment}
As a drop of water moves though air it compresses some of the air in front of the droplet which causes a high pressure ahead of the droplet and low pressure behind the droplet. The low pressure along with the turbulence created, results in a drag force behind the droplet. This drag force pulls air along behind the droplet as it moves.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/Droplet_Etrainment.png}
\caption{Air Flows Around a Droplet}
\label{fig:droplet_flow}
\end{figure}

This same concept can be applied to fire service hose streams. As the water from the stream flows through air it displaces air in front of it creating a lower pressure behind the water and pulling air along its path. A practical application of this in the fire service is the use of a hose stream for ventilation (hydraulic ventilation). Water is directed out an opening and the as the stream breaks up the droplets pull the smoke through the same opening to ventilate the structure.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/Hydraulic_Ventilation.png}
\caption{Hydraulic Ventilation}
\label{fig:Hydraulic_Vent}
\end{figure}
 
Understanding the principals of air entrainment can help firefighters understand how their action will move more or less air. Entrainment is based on several different factors including hose stream type, stream length, and nozzle movement, many of which are choices for the firefighter operating the nozzle.

\section{With Air Entrainment - Smooth bore \& Straight Stream are the Same} 
Smooth bore nozzles have often been thought of as having more `penetration' then straight stream nozzles \cite{Klaene:1}. As far as air entrainment is concerned, there is no practical difference between a smooth bore nozzle and a combination nozzle set to straight stream. The amount of dispersion (break up) in the two streams is similar, which results in a similar air entrainment. Figure~\ref{fig:SS_vs_SB} shows all of the 1$\frac{3}{4}$~in smooth bore and straight stream nozzles tested when operating in the fixed position. The values from the 21 different nozzle configurations show no discernible difference between the manufacturers or nozzle type.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/SB_SS_All_Manufacture.pdf}
\caption{Straight Stream vs. Smooth Bore Across Manufacturers}
\label{fig:SS_vs_SB}
\end{figure}

This also holds true when a smooth bore and straight stream are both being used to produce a movement pattern. For instance in an `O' pattern with a smooth bore does not result in any less air entrainment than a straight stream. Figure~\ref{fig:SS_vs_SB_O} shows all of the 1$\frac{3}{4}$~in nozzles tested with an `O' pattern. Moving the nozzle increases the air entrainment similarly for both a smooth bore and straight stream, regardless of the flow or pressure. Over the 21 different tests there is no discernible difference between manufacturers or nozzle type. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/SB_SS_All_O_Manufacture.pdf}
\caption{Straight Stream vs. Smooth Bore Across Manufacturers - `O' Pattern}
\label{fig:SS_vs_SB_O}
\end{figure}

In the context of structural fire suppression using hand held hose streams, both streams entrain the same amount of air when operated in the same manor. 

\section{Increasing the Width of a Fog Pattern Increases Air Entrainment}
The amount of air moved with a fire service hose stream depends on how much the stream breaks up. The amount the stream breaks up is often thought of in terms of the stream type (Smooth Bore, Straight Stream, and Fog). Understanding how the three stream types can either increase or decrease air entrainment provides the nozzle firefighter with tactical options when faced with a situation where they need to move more or less air. 

When a combination nozzle is utilized, the nozzle firefighter has additional tactical choices. As the nozzle pattern is adjusted from straight stream, to narrow fog, to wide fog, it causes the stream to break up progressively more. This leads to more entrainment as the stream goes from straight stream to wide fog. Figure~\ref{fig:StraightStream_Fog_Comp} shows this for three positions, straight stream, narrow fog and wide fog, with the nozzle 3~ft from an opening, simulating hydraulic ventilation. In the context of hydraulic ventilation, the intent is to move as much air as possible, therefore adjusting the nozzle to a wide fog results in significantly more air movement, almost double that of the narrow fog.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Script_Figures/Entrainment/Opening_Occlusion}
\caption{Straight Stream vs. Narrow Fog vs. Wide Fog - 3~ft from opening}
\label{fig:StraightStream_Fog_Comp}
\end{figure}

If the same nozzle is being used in a scenario where the nozzle firefighter is looking to limit the amount of air moved the nozzle should be placed in the straight stream pattern. 

\section{An Increase in Stream Length Increases Air Entrainment}
Without the aid of modern personal protective equipment, early fire service nozzles needed to be designed for reach; to provide protection for firefighters by keeping distance between them and the fire. A long reach also meant a greater ability to suppress fires on upper floors without having to drag hose lines through the building. However the longer the distance a hose stream travels before it hits a surface (stream length) the more air the stream will entrain.

Keeping all other factors the same, as a hose stream is moved back from and opening, it exhausts more and more air from the structure. Figure~\ref{fig:Setback} shows the different values recorded at 3~ft increments back from a double door with a narrow fog. The farther back the nozzle is from the opening the more air is entrained in the hose stream. The same holds true for a nozzle on the exterior of the structure. The farther back from the opening, the more air will be moved through that opening. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Script_Figures/Entrainment/Setback_Distance_Comparison.pdf}
\caption{Effect of Stream Length on Entrainment}
\label{fig:Setback}
\end{figure}

When applying water from the exterior into a compartment, limiting the air entrainment limits the amount the vent is blocked, maximizing the amount of products of combustion that can escape. Locating the nozzle a close but safe distance from the opening limits the air entrainment. The farther from the opening the nozzle is located the more air is entrained. Comparing the two exterior attacks in Figure~\ref{fig:ExteriorDist}, the one with the nozzle close to the opening provides the least entrainment maintaining the greatest exhaust of the compartment.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/Exterior_Attack.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/Exterior_Attack_Far.png}
\caption{Distance From the Opening has an Impact on Air Entrainment}
\label{fig:ExteriorDist}
\end{figure}

When using a nozzle for hydraulic ventilation the intent is to provide the greatest air entrainment (exhaust). In this case, the nozzle should be located as far back in the room as possible. Increasing the length of the stream located inside the structure, will in turn, increase the air entrainment. As Figure~\ref{fig:Setback} shows, the exhaust capabilities of nozzles located at at 9~ft are almost double that of the case where the nozzle was 3~ft from the opening. 

\section{Nozzle Movement Increases Entrainment}
Often, engine company tactics have the goal of moving air with a hose stream. In the case of a structure fire, the intent is often to move products of combustion or `Smoke'. As the nozzle firefighter understanding how different nozzle movement can entrain more air or less air can aid in accomplishing the intended tactic. 

The amount of air or `smoke' moved by the nozzle is proportional to the speed the nozzle is moved. Moving the nozzle causes the stream to break up. The faster the nozzle is moved the more of droplets are created, increasing entrainment. This is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Nozzle_Movement_RotationSpeed_Comparison} where the number of revolutions in an `O' pattern is increased from 50/min to 100/min and finally 150/min. As the speed of movement increases, the amount of air moved increases respectively. A firefighter trying to move air or smoke, should increase the movement of the nozzle. Inversely, a firefighter trying to move as little air as possible should hold the nozzle as still as possible.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/O_Patern_Visual.png} \\
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/Air_Entrainment/Z_Patern_Visual.png}

\caption{Typical Nozzle Patterns - `O', `Z', and `n'}
\label{fig:O_Z_N_Pattern}
\end{figure}

When the intent is to move air, the pattern chosen has little effect on the entrainment. Using a `O', `Z', `n' or just moving the nozzle rapidly `Spray and Pray' all have similar air entrainment. The Figures in \ref{fig:Nozzle_Movement_PatterntoNoPattern_Comparison} show roughly 5000~CFM for all the nozzle patterns tested, regardless of pattern or nozzle type. 

\section{Comparing Entrainment to PPV Fan Exhaust}
When the intent is to move the most air, a fog stream in an `O' pattern, was seen to produce the most airflow. At 10~ft back from the opening values in excess of 15000~CFM were recorded. For comparison (Figure~\ref{fig:PPV}), a PPV fan was found to flow approximately 8000~CFM on a 1:1 exhaust to inlet ratio in a single story structure. When the exhaust to inlet ration was 2:1 the same fan was flowing approximately 1500~CFM \cite{Zevotek_Kerber:2016}. If the intent is to provide hydraulic ventilation, a narrow fog moved in an `O' pattern, as far back from the opening as possible, will entrain just as much air as positive pressure ventilation. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Script_Figures/Entrainment/PPV.pdf}
\caption[Single Story Structure Exhaust - PPV]{Single Story Structure Exhaust - PPV \cite{Zevotek_Kerber:2016}}
\label{fig:PPV}
\end{figure}

\section{What Did Not Affect Air Entrainment}
Tactical choices such as nozzle pressure, nozzle flow rate and hose size (1$\frac{3}{4}$~in vs. 2$\frac{1}{2}$~in) are often thought to have additional implications other than increased flow. This did not hold true for air entrainment. Choosing a larger hose line, higher nozzle pressure of larger flow rate did not provide any difference in the amount of air entrained. Although these things do impact the pressure loss in the hose, nozzle reaction, manpower needed, and total water flow, they do not impact air entrainment.

\chapter{Future Research Needs}

The air entrainment data presented in this report is a one piece of the fire attack study. The intention of this report is to provide preliminary results and insight into the amount of air entrained by hose streams based on pre-determined variables and parameters. The water distribution data and full-scale fire test data are additional components to the study which are needed to create a holistic understanding. Upon completion of the entire analysis, conclusions can be drawn and tactical considerations can be developed regarding each experimental series, the relationships between the series, and the project in its entirety.  

\chapter{Summary}

This series of experiments looked to quantify air entrainment by hand held fire hose streams, expanding on work already done looking at hydraulic ventilation \cite{KnappNozzles1}, \cite{KnappNozzles2}, \cite{KnappNozzles3}. The results show to increase entrainment, a firefighter should create a more broken stream or fog pattern, move the nozzle rapidly and provide the largest stream length. If the intent is to limit air entrainment the nozzle firefighter should use a fixed nozzle position on a smooth bore or straight stream, limiting the stream length where possible.  No difference was seen between air entrainment in a smooth bore vs. a straight stream. Understanding these key concepts of air entrainment can aid firefighters in being more effective. Applying these concepts to structural firefighter allows for better control of air entrainment during both interior and exterior operations.
